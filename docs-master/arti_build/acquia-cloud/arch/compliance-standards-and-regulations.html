<p>When it comes to cloud service providers, it is in an organization’s
best interest to perform due diligence on vendor’s compliance with
applicable industry standards and regulations. What organizations deploy
to the cloud may be governed by some form of regulatory standard. If you
require additional information regarding your particular regulatory
requirements, contact Acquia.</p>
<p>This page summarizes Acquia’s compliance with the following standards

<p>Statement on Standards for Attestation Engagement (SSAE) No. 16 is an
American auditing standard issued by the American Institute of Certified
Public Accountants (AIPCA) and is used to create a Service Organization
Control (SOC) 1 branded report. Acquia’s SSAE 16 audit report is aligned
with the International Standards for Assurance Engagements (ISAE) No.
3402 auditing standard. This allows for the report to be recognized both
in the U.S. and throughout the world.</p>
<p>Acquia has a SOC 1 SSAE 16/ISAE 3402 Type 2 audit performed on an annual
basis by an independent third-party audit firm. The audit report attests
to the design and operating effectiveness of Acquia’s business and
security controls in safeguarding systems and data. Acquia’s SSAE
16/ISAE 3402 audit report is available to current customers and

<p>A SOC 2 report, titled “Report on Controls at a Service Organization
Relevant to Security, Availability, Processing Integrity,
Confidentiality or Privacy” is designed to meet a broad set of reporting
needs about the controls at a service organization in the form of a CPA
firm’s independent attestation report. SOC 2 reports are based on the
following AICPA Trust Services Principles and Criteria (TSPC):</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><em>Security</em> - The system is protected against unauthorized access
(both physical and logical).</li>
<li><em>Availability</em> - The system is available for operation and use as
committed or agreed.</li>
<li><em>Processing Integrity</em> - System processing is complete, accurate,
timely, and authorized.</li>
<li><em>Confidentiality</em> - Information designated as confidential is
protected as committed or agreed.</li>
<li><em>Privacy</em> - Personal information is collected, used, retained,
disclosed, and destroyed in conformity with the commitments in the
entity’s privacy notice and with criteria set forth in Generally
Accepted Privacy Principles issued by the AICPA and CICA. The TSPC of
security, availability, and processing integrity are used to evaluate
whether a system is reliable.</li>
</ul>
<p>Acquia has a SOC 2 Type 2 audit performed on an annual basis by an
independent third party audit firm. The audit report attests to the
suitability of the design and operating effectiveness of Acquia’s

<span id="pci-dss"></span><h2>PCI<a class="headerlink" href="#pci" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS) compliance
applies to merchants and services providers that process, store, or
transmit credit card data. PCI DSS is a multifaceted security standard
that includes requirements for security management, policies and
procedures, network architecture, software design, and other critical
protective measures. This comprehensive standard helps organizations
proactively protect credit card data that is transmitted or stored on
the Acquia platform. Acquia’s PCI compliance is only applicable to
customers that build web applications within the Acquia shared PCI
Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) or via dedicated PCI VPC Shield offering.
Acquia has been validated by an independent Quality Security Assessor
(QSA) approved by the PCI Security Standards Council that validated
Acquia’s adherence with standards applicable to a Level 1 service
provider under PCI DSS Version 3.2. The Attestation of Compliance (AOC)
and Report on Compliance (ROC) documents validate Acquia’s PCI DSS
compliance, and can be provided to prospective or current customers upon
request.</p>
<p>Acquia Cloud Enterprise and Acquia Cloud Site Factory subscribers with websites
that require PCI DSS compliant environments should contact their Account
Manager to discuss additional infrastructure changes that may be
required for their websites to meet PCI DSS requirements.</p>
<p>Acquia Cloud for Partners subscribers with websites that require
PCI DSS compliant environments should contact Acquia Support by creating
a <a class="reference external" href="/support#contact%22">support ticket</a>.</p>
<p>Although Acquia provides a PCI-compliant hosting environment as part of
Acquia Cloud Enterprise, only your PCI QSA or your internal security
resource completing a PCI DSS self assessment questionnaire (SAQ) can
confirm if the way your website processes credit card payments will meet
PCI DSS compliance requirements. We encourage you to contact your QSA
auditor with any additional questions that you may have. Acquia cannot
determine if your website is PCI DSS compliant.</p>
<p>Websites is hosted on Acquia Cloud that processes payments
through a third party service (such as WorldPay, Paypal, or
Authorize.net) are generally PCI DSS compliant.</p>
<p>The Acquia Security team has spoken at length with our PCI-Auditors, as
well as a number of PCI auditors that work with our customers. Because
your website is connected to your payment gateway, it is considered
in-scope for PCI DSS compliance.</p>
<p>This means that your main website, which is hosted with Acquia, is
required to be PCI DSS compliant, even though the transaction is
performed through a third party service. Consequently, your website
would need to be moved into our shared VPC to meet PCI DSS compliance.</p>

compliant
system</a>
and has received an agency Authority to Operate (ATO) from the
Department of the Treasury. As a FedRAMP compliant Cloud Service
Provider (CSP) supporting U.S. government agencies and departments,
Acquia is committed to meeting the guidelines of FedRAMP and will
provide insight into Acquia’s security architecture and the continuous
monitoring processes related to the Acquia Platform as a Service (PaaS).</p>
<p>Our system has been designed to meet NIST 800-53 standards for customers
who must complete their local security authorization process, sometimes
called the Risk Management Framework (RMF), or FISMA.</p>
<p>In addition, Acquia Cloud is built on Amazon AWS and thus
inherits Infrastructure layer controls from Amazon. Separately, Amazon
AWS has received <a class="reference external" href="https://aws.amazon.com/compliance/fedramp/">FedRAMP
authorization</a> for the
Infrastructure layer.</p>

<div class="section" id="fisma">
<h2>FISMA<a class="headerlink" href="#fisma" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Acquia enables US government agencies to achieve and sustain compliance
with FISMA. Numerous Federal organizations have successfully achieved
security authorizations and made risk-based decisions to allow websites
to be hosted on Acquia Cloud in accordance with the Risk
Management Framework (RMF) process defined in the NIST Special
Publication (SP) 800-37. Acquia’s platform has helped federal agencies
expand cloud computing use cases and deploy sensitive government data
and applications in the cloud, while complying with the rigorous
security requirements of federal standards.</p>

<p>The Cloud Security Alliance (CSA) is a not-for-profit organization with
a mission to promote the use of best practices for providing security
assurance within Cloud Computing and to provide education on the uses of
Cloud Computing to help secure all other forms of computing. The CSA is
led by a broad coalition of industry practitioners, corporations,
associations, and other key stakeholders.</p>
<p>CSA’s Security, Trust and Assurance Registry (STAR) is a free, publicly
accessible registry that documents the security controls provided by
cloud computing offerings, thereby helping organizations assess the
security of cloud providers they currently use or are considering
contracting with. Acquia has completed and published its Consensus
Assessments Initiative Questionnaire (CAIQ), which provides
industry-accepted ways to document the security controls in our PaaS
(platform as a service) offering. The CAIQ provides a set of over 140
questions that a cloud consumer and cloud auditor may wish to ask of a
cloud provider.</p>
