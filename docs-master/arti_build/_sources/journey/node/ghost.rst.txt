Ghost node
==========

|ghost node|

The **Ghost node** is a placeholder node created when you use the drag
handle to create a new node. The Ghost node is not executable, but
allows you to map out your graph before replacing it with the node,
graph, or adaptor of your choice. Graphs containing ghost nodes are not
valid graphs, and will not execute until all ghost nodes are replaced
with valid nodes, graphs, or adaptors.
