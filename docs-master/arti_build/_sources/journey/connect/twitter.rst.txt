Twitter connection
==================

To create a *Twitter connection*, you must first create a `Twitter
App <https://apps.twitter.com/app/new>`__ in a Twitter development
account. Ensure that you provide the App with the relevant read/write
permissions.

After you set up your Twitter App, you must connect to Twitter by
configuring a Twitter connection, which will allow you to use a Twitter
`adaptor </journey/adaptors>`__ with your project.

For information about creating, configuring, or testing connections, see
|connections|_.

   Twitter.

-  **OAuth Access Token** - The identifier that describes the access
   levels for the account (for example, read-only rights or read and
   write rights).
