Initial |acquia-product:aj| user experience
===========================================

New users will receive an email that contains their username, which is
your email address, and the one-time security token used for your first
time signing in to |acquia-product:aj|.

Clicking on the link in the email will redirect you to the login page:

|Sign in page|

Click the **Set my Password** link to display the **Set password**
dialog box:

|Set password dialog box|

Enter the security token from the email and create a new password. Be
sure to use a secure password. After your password is accepted, revisit
the main sign in page and use your email address and new password to
access |acquia-product:aj|.

After signing in, you are ready to work with |acquia-product:aj|,
whether that is `creating your first
project </journey/getting-started/project>`__ or `adding new
users </journey/admin/users>`__.

started with |acquia-product:aj| </journey/getting-started>`__
