`Twitter <http://twitter.com/>`__ is a realtime messaging platform. The
Twitter adaptor allows you to interact with your customers by reading
and sending tweets, while listening for likes, hashtags, mentions, and
direct messages in your Twitter stream.

You can interact with Twitter from your
`graphs </journey/getting-started/graph>`__ using the following
adaptors:

-  `Read </journey/adaptors/twitter/read>`__ - Query Twitter for a
   profile of a specific user, that user's friends, or that user's likes
-  `Write </journey/adaptors/twitter/write>`__ - Send a tweet, reply
   to a tweet, retweet, or send a direct message to a specific user
-  `Listen </journey/adaptors/twitter/listen>`__ - Drive your graph
   based on the Twitter stream of a specific user, or using specific
   keywords
