Web service: GET method
=======================

For instructions about how to modify the URL resource and query
parameters, see `REST web service adaptor </journey/adaptors/rest>`__.

The Web Service GET method issues a ``HTTP GET`` request to a web
service end point and expects a JSON response. To create a web service
GET method, it is first necessary to create a `web service
connection </journey/connect/rest>`__.

After you create or select the REST Web Service adaptor, review the
values in the following lists:

-  **Adaptor Connection**
-  **Method** - Be sure this is set to **GET**
