Creating a project
==================

New projects are created on the |acquia-product:aj| home screen. Each
project contains one or more related `journeys </journey/mapper>`__,
graphs, and `metrics </journey/metrics>`__, allowing you to plan and
orchestrate customer journeys.

        If |acquia-product:aj| does not display a plus icon for your use, you
        do not have permission to create a new project. Contact your website
        administrator to request permission to create new projects.

   **Description**.
#. Click **Create**.

The new project's card appears on the |acquia-product:aj| home screen.
Projects are listed in order of creation, with the oldest project listed
first.

Filtering the project list
--------------------------

You can filter the project list by clicking the **Search Project Name**
field, and then entering a search string. The filter is applied
automatically as you type each letter, updating the home screen with
projects that match your filter as you type.
