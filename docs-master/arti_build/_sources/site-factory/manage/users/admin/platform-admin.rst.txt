Platform admin role
===================

The *platform admin* role on |acquia-product:edg| should be assigned to
privileged users who have overall responsibility for the
|acquia-product:edg| deployment. When |acquia-product:edg| is first
provisioned for a client, a single account is assigned the *platform
admin* role. The owner of the first *platform admin* account can create
other *platform admin* accounts as necessary.

Users with the *platform admin* role can manage all websites and OpenID
single sign-on user accounts. The ability to manage all websites and
OpenID accounts differentiates the *platform admin* role from the `*site
builder* </site-factory/users/admin/site-builder>`__ role.

Users that are assigned the *platform admin* role can perform the
following actions on |acquia-product:edg|:

- Sign in to |acquia-product:edg|
- `View websites on  </site-factory/manage/website/manage>`__
- `Specify login authentication mode </site-factory/manage/login-mode>`__

.. note::  

   The *platform admin* has only administrative privileges for those
   websites to which they have been assigned administrative roles.

Perform website management actions on all of the websites on
|acquia-product:edg|, including:

-  `Managing domains </site-factory/manage/website/domains>`__
-  `Duplicating the site </site-factory/manage/website/duplicate>`__
-  `Exporting the site </site-factory/manage/website/backup>`__
-  `Enable installation
   profiles </site-factory/manage/preferences/profiles>`__
-  `Configuring the siteâ€™s Terms of
   Service </site-factory/manage/website/tos>`__
-  `Create and download site
   backups </site-factory/manage/website/backup>`__
-  `Deleting the site </site-factory/manage/website/delete>`__
-  `Transferring ownership of the site to
   others </site-factory/manage/website/transfer>`__
-  `Specify the global Terms of Services for all sites </site-factory/manage/website/tos>`__
-  `Create user accounts </site-factory/users>`__
-  `Delete, block, and unlock users </site-factory/users>`__
-  `Assign roles to users </site-factory/users>`__
