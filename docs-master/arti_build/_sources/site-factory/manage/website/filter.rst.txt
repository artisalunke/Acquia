Finding sites with filters
==========================

Depending on how many websites you have access to in the management
interface (or how you have your websites organized), it may be difficult
to find the website you're interested in without having to look at page
after page of available websites.

To reduce the number of displayed websites on the All my sites page, use
the filter options to display only the websites that meet your criteria.

Using filters
-------------

To reduce the number of displayed websites:

Expand the **Filter results** section.

Enter values in the filters. You can limit which websites are displayed
based on the following criteria:

-  **Factory stack** - If you have more than one `Site Factory
   Stack </site-factory/tiers/stacks>`__, which Stack the website
   belongs to.
-  **Min. number of posts** - Based on comment posts to website content
-  **Min. number of users** - Based on authenticated user accounts
-  **Min. number of themes** - Based on websites' created themes
-  **Min. disk usage (kB)** - Based on websites' files and content
   stored on disk
-  **Min. page views last month**
-  **Min. page views this month**
-  **Min. visits last month**
-  **Min. visits this month**
-  **Domain contains** - Websites whose domain names contain the entered
   text
-  **Domain does not contain** - Websites whose domain names do not
   contain the entered text
-  **Site owner username** - Based on websites' owner accounts

Select the **Has custom domains** check box to display only those
websites with one or more associated custom domains.

Click **Apply**.

The page reloads and displays only the websites that meet the filter
criteria.
