Completing the process
======================

Custom domains

-  `Prepare </site-factory/manage/domains>`__
-  `Point </site-factory/manage/domains/point>`__
-  `Verify </site-factory/manage/domains/verify>`__
-  `Email </site-factory/manage/domains/email>`__
-  Complete

Complete the following steps to add a custom domain name to your
website, depending on the features that you have installed:

-  `Professional fonts <#fonts>`__
-  `External Links module <#external>`__

.. _fonts:

Professional fonts
------------------

If you are `using professional fonts </site-factory/theme/fonts>`__ on
your website, you must reconfigure your external font provider account
(including Typekit and Fonts.com) to include your new domain name.

Typekit domain name change
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Typekit maps your account to one or more domain names. After you point a
custom domain name to your |acquia-product:edg| website, you must
reconfigure your Typekit kit.

#. Click **Launch Kit Editor** to change the settings for your account.

   |Launch Kit Editor button|

#. Add the new domain name in the **Domains** text field, deleting the
   domain name you will no longer be using if necessary.

   |Kit Settings tab|

.. _external:

External Links module
---------------------

If your website uses the `External
Links <https://drupal.org/project/extlink>`__ module, validate your
website's external links pattern matching to ensure that it's configured
to handle new custom domains.

For more information, see `External
links </site-factory/feature/display/external-links>`__.

.. _done:

You're done!
------------

Your |acquia-product:edg| website or site collection is now available to
your site visitors at your custom domain!
