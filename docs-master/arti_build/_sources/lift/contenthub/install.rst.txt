To use |acquia-product:ch|, you must install a set of Drupal modules
(called the |acquia-product:ch| client) on each of the websites in your
content network that will be sharing content with each other. Also,
remember that you are not limited to using only the client modules â€” you
can also share content by |useapi|_ with your websites.

.. |useapi| replace:: using the  \ |acquia-product:ch|\  API
.. _useapi: content-hub/api
