|acquia-product:leb| allows you to track your website visitors' behavior
and build content experiences tailored to those visitors' interests.
Instead of having to use a separate application with its own interface
and API to target content to your visitors, |acquia-product:leb|
integrates tightly with `Drupal <https://www.drupal.org/>`__, allowing
you to leverage the Drupal skills and knowledge you've developed from
maintaining your website.
