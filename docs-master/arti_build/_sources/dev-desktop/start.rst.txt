   Select this option to create a new website based on one of a variety of popular Drupal distributions.
-  `Start with an existing Drupal site located on my computer </dev-desktop/start/local>`__ |br| 
   Select this option either if you already have a Drupal website that you have been working on locally, or in the following cases:

   -  If you want to start with a Drupal distribution that isn't included with |acquia-product:add|, you need to first download the Drupal distribution to your computer.
   -  If you have an existing Drupal website that's hosted elsewhere than on |acquia-product:ac|, you need to first export your Drupal website to your computer.

-  `Start with an existing Drupal website hosted on Acquia Cloud </dev-desktop/start/cloud>`__ |br| 
   Select this option if you already have a Drupal website hosted on |acquia-product:ac| that you want to work on locally using |acquia-product:add|.
