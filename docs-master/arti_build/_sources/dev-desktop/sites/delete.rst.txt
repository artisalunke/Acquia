Deleting a local site
=====================

You can delete a local website that you have previously added to
|acquia-product:add|.

#. Select the website that you want to delete.
#. Click the **-** button at the bottom of the |acquia-product:add| UI.
#. Click **Yes** to confirm that you want to delete the website.

The website will be completely deleted, including the codebase, files,
and database and cannot be recovered using |acquia-product:add|.

Note

If you delete a website that is hosted on |acquia-product:ac|, you
delete only the local version of the website and do not affect the
website on |acquia-product:ac|.
