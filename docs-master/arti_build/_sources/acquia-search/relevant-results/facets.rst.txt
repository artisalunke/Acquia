The real power of the Apache Solr search technology comes into play when
users only have a broad idea of what they are looking for when starting
a search.

**Search facets**, also known as filters, are a part of the Solr search
technology powering Acquia Search. They allow users to refine or sort
their search result set. Users can begin with a general search and
narrow down the result set as they understand better what content is
available on your site.

Once a user has started a search by entering one or more search terms
and clicking **Search**, the results page can feature a number of blocks
that show filters, sorting links, the current search, and more. For
example:

|Search by site|
|Search by tag|
|Search by content type|
