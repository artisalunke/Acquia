Installing Acquia Demo Framework from AWS Test Drive
====================================================

Here's how to test drive Acquia Demo Framework, starting from the `AWS
Drupal Test Drive page <https://aws.amazon.com/testdrive/drupal/>`__.
Acquia Demo Framework is a starter kit for showcasing Acquia’s
enterprise-­ready Drupal solutions for different use cases and business
scenarios. Demo Framework can be used by systems integrators, resellers,
development shops, and agencies to highlight the value of Drupal and
Acquia to their customers.

Start by clicking the **Try it now free button** on the `AWS Drupal Test
Drive page <https://aws.amazon.com/testdrive/drupal/>`__. You will be
asked to create a new subscription:

|Create an Acquia Cloud Free subscription|

#. Enter a Site name to identify your website.
#. Select your Geographic region.
#. Enter your contact information and create a password.
#. Read and accept the terms of service.
#. Click **Create site**. A progress wheel will appear.
#. A new **Create Site** page will load.
#. Acquia will provision and install your website, and update your code.
   This will take a few minutes. You can use this time to watch the
   video tutorials.

   |Provisioning your website|

#. After Acquia has set up your |acquia-product:ac| website, you will be
   given two options on the left side of the page: **Set up my site (Go
   to my new distribution)** or **Manage my code (Go to the workflow
   page)**. Click the orange **Set up my site** button.
#. You will be taken to a new page titled **Installing Demo Framework**.
   This is the Drupal install page. Drupal verifies requirements, sets
   up a database, and installs a profile. A progress bar shows the
   status of the installation. This may take a few minutes.

Configuring your Acquia Demo Framework site
-------------------------------------------

|Configure the Demo Framework|

After the installation completes, you can configure your Acquia Demo
Framework website.

#. Under **Enable a Scenario**, select the **WEM demo**, a Web
   Experience Management scenario with users, content, pages, products,
   blocks and taxonomy terms.
#. Provide a **Site name** and **Site email address**. Automated
   e-mails, such as registration information, will be sent from this
   address. Use an address ending in your website's domain to help
   prevent these emails from being flagged as spam.
#. Create a **Site Maintenance Account**. This is the user name, email
   address, and password for the primary user of the website.
#. Optionally, select your desired Server Settings and Update
   Notifications.
#. Click **Save and continue**.

Your Acquia Demo Framework installation is complete. The demo website
opens and you can begin to explore its many features. Click the Menu
button in the upper left corner to begin configuring the website for
Content, Structure, and Appearance.
