Installing OpenPublic from AWS Test Drive
=========================================

Here's how to test drive OpenPublic, starting from the `AWS Drupal Test
Drive page <https://aws.amazon.com/testdrive/drupal/>`__. OpenPublic,
maintained by Phase2 Technology, is a Drupal distribution specially
designed for open government­­ — without compromising accessibility,
security, or usability.

Start by clicking the **Try it now free button** on the `AWS Drupal Test
Drive page <https://aws.amazon.com/testdrive/drupal/>`__. You will be
asked to create a new subscription:

|Create an Acquia Cloud Free subscription|

#. Enter a Site name to identify your website.
#. Select your Geographic region.
#. Enter your contact information and create a password.
#. Read and accept the terms of service.
#. Click **Create site**. A progress wheel will appear.
#. A new **Create Site** page will load.
#. Acquia will provision and install your website, and update your code.
   This will take a few minutes. You can use this time to watch the
   video tutorials.

   |Provisioning your website|

#. After Acquia has set up your |acquia-product:ac| website, you will be
   given two options on the left side of the page: **Set up my site (Go
   to my new distribution)** or **Manage my code (Go to the workflow
   page)**. Click the orange **Set up my site** button.

You will be taken to the Drupal Open Public install page.

Configuring your OpenPublic site
--------------------------------

|Configuring OpenPublic|

You can now configure your OpenPublic website.

#. Select the OpenPublic installation profile. Click **Save and
   continue**.
#. Select English. Click **Save and continue**.
#. Drupal verifies requirements, sets up a database, and installs a
   profile. A progress bar shows the status of the installation. This
   may take a few minutes.

   |OpenPublic configuration, continued|

#. The Site name will automatically populate. You can modify this as you
   like.
#. Provide a **Site email address**. Automated e-mails, such as
   registration information, will be sent from this address. Use an
   address ending in your website's domain to help prevent these emails
   from being flagged as spam.
#. Create a **Site Maintenance Account**. This is the user name, email
   address, and password for the primary user of the website.
#. Optionally, select your desired Server Settings and Update
   Notifications, then click **Save and continue**.
#. On the **Verify Apps Support** page, click **Continue**.
#. On the **Install Apps** page, click **Skip this step**.

Your OpenPublic installation is complete. Click **Visit your new site**.

You will be taken to your new OpenPublic Drupal website.
