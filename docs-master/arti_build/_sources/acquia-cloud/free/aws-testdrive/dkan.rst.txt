Installing DKAN from AWS Test Drive
===================================

Here's how to test drive DKAN, starting from the `AWS Drupal Test Drive
page <https://aws.amazon.com/testdrive/drupal/>`__.
`DKAN <https://getdkan.org/>`__ is a Drupal-based open data platform
with a full suite of cataloging, publishing and visualization features
that allows governments, nonprofits, and universities to easily publish
data to the public.

Start by clicking the **Try it now free button** on the `AWS Drupal Test
Drive page <https://aws.amazon.com/testdrive/drupal/>`__.You will be
asked to create a new subscription:

|Create an Acquia Cloud Free subscription|

#. Enter a Site name to identify your website.
#. Select your Geographic region.
#. Enter your contact information and create a password.
#. Read and accept the terms of service.
#. Click **Create site**. A progress wheel will appear.
#. A new **Create Site** page will load.
#. Acquia will provision and install your website, and update your code.
   This will take a few minutes. You can use this time to watch the
   video tutorials.

   |Provisioning your website|

#. After Acquia has set up your |acquia-product:ac| website, you will be
   given two options on the left side of the page: **Set up my site (Go
   to my new distribution)** or **Manage my code (Go to the workflow
   page)**. Click the orange **Set up my site** button.
#. You will be taken to a new page titled **Installing DKAN**. This is
   the Drupal install page. Under Choose language, leave English
   selected and click **Save and continue**. Drupal verifies
   requirements, sets up a database, and installs a profile. A progress
   bar shows the status of the installation. This may take a few
   minutes.

After the installation completes, you can configure your DKAN website.

#. Provide a **Site name** and **Site email address**. Automated
   e-mails, such as registration information, will be sent from this
   address. Use an address ending in your website's domain to help
   prevent these emails from being flagged as spam.
#. Create a **Site Maintenance Account**. This is the user name, email
   address, and password for the primary user of the website.
#. Optionally, select your desired Server Settings and Update
   Notifications.
#. Click **Save and continue**.

Your DKAN installation is complete. The DKAN website opens and you can
begin to explore its features.
