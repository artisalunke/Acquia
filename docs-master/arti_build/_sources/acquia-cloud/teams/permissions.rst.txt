About |acquia-product:ac| permissions
=====================================

   /acquia-cloud/teams/permissions/*

A *permission* grants a user the ability to perform specific operations
in an |acquia-product:ac| organization or application. Permissions are
grouped into roles. Roles are then assigned to team members. All the
team members who have the same roles have the same permissions.

Acquia defines over 40 separate, grouped permissions, listed in the
following `Permissions list <#list>`__ table. You can also view all the
available permissions by opening the **Roles** page for an organization
and viewing a role, as described in `Working with roles and permissions:
Viewing a role's permissions </acquia-cloud/teams/roles#view>`__.

Many permissions enable you to distinguish between team members who can
work on an application's production environment and team members who can
only work on the non-production (Dev and Stage) environments. For
example, the *Senior developer* role includes the permissions to pull
and deploy code in production and non-production environments, while the
*Developer* role grants permission to pull and deploy code only in
non-production environments. **Since |acquia-product:acfs| applications
do not have production environments, those permissions do not apply to
those applications.**

Permissions in |acquia-product:ac| do not control actions users take on
your Drupal website, such as:

-  Creating content
-  Enabling and configuring Drupal modules
-  Adding or removing Drupal users

Use the Drupal permissions administration to control access to Drupal
functions.

.. admonition:: Note for |acquia-product:edg| subscribers

   |acquia-product:edg| customers must use the `|acquia-product:edg|
   domains
   functionality </site-factory/manage/website/domains/point/cname-site>`__
   to add additional domains to their subscriptions. Domains added using
   the |acquia-product:ac| user interface will not work, and may be deleted
   by automated processes.
