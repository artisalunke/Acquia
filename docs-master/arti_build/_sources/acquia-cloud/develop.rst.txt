After you have `created </acquia-cloud/create/install>`__ or
`imported </acquia-cloud/create/import>`__ an application on
|acquia-product:ac|, you can use the powerful features of the Acquia
platform to develop, test, maintain, and update your website, including
the |acquia-product:ui|, the `Cloud API </acquia-cloud/api>`__, Drush,
and more.

The principal parts of a Drupal application are the following:

-  *`Codebase </acquia-cloud/develop/code>`__* - Drupal's core modules,
   contributed modules, and your custom code
-  *`Database </acquia-cloud/manage/database>`__* - Stores the
   application's content and configuration
-  *`Files </acquia-cloud/manage/files>`__* - Images, digital assets,
   and user-uploaded files

Using the |acquia-product:ui|, you can manage the development and
testing of these elements on your Development and Staging environments
before deploying them to your live application in the Production
environment.

Here are some topics that can guide you as you use |acquia-product:ac|
for your application development tasks:

-  `Managing applications with the
   |acquia-product:ui| </acquia-cloud/manage>`__
-  `Working with code </acquia-cloud/develop/code>`__
-  `Working with databases </acquia-cloud/manage/database>`__
-  `Developing a Drupal website on
   |acquia-product:ac| </acquia-cloud/develop/drupal>`__
