Migrating applications between subscriptions
============================================

There may occasions when you need to move the contents of an
|acquia-product:ac| application in one subscription to an application in
another subscription to which you have access. The migration process is
possible to :ref:`undertake yourself <self>`, but can also be accomplished
with assistance from |acquia-product:onb|.

Migrating a website with |acquia-product:onb|
---------------------------------------------

Because migrating an application can be a complicated process, if you
require assistance or if you need to accomplish specific tasks (such as
moving an application from one site group to another), contact
|acquia-product:onb| to schedule an engagement. For more information
about how |acquia-product:onb| can work with you to ensure that your
application is migrated successfully, see `Internal migrations with
Acquia Ready </acquia-cloud/ready/migration/internal>`__.

If you need to move an application's contents in one subscription to an
application in another subscription, before you begin a migration, you
should review the following pages:

-  `Internal migrations with Acquia
   Ready </acquia-cloud/ready/migration/internal>`__

   governance </resources/governance/migrate>`__

.. note::

    It is not possible to complete move an application or website from one
    |acquia-product:ac| site group to another site group.

other data, refer to the procedures on the following pages:
