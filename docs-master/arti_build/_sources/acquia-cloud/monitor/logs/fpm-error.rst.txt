FPM error logs
==============

The *FPM error log* records server-level issues with FPM's process
management in PHP. It is closely related to the `PHP error
log </acquia-cloud/monitor/logs/php-error>`__, which records
application-level issues encountered while processing a request. The FPM
error log only handles web requests; command-line requests are logged in
the PHP error log.

For a list of the log files handled by |acquia-product:ac|, including
accessing these log files, log file retention, and their locations, see
|aboutlogging|_.
