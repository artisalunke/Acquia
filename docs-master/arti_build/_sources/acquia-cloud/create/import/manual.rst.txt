As described in `Importing an existing
application </acquia-cloud/create/import>`__, there are several
different methods available for importing an application into
|acquia-product:ac|. This section describes the manual process, which is
the most complicated approach. In the manual process, you manually
import your code, database, and files separately. It may be the best
approach for multisite installations or for very large Drupal
applications.

To manually import your application to |acquia-product:ac|, complete the
following steps:

#. `Enable SSH </acquia-cloud/ssh/enable>`__, so that you can connect
   with your |acquia-product:ac| servers using the command line.
#. `Import your application's
   code </acquia-cloud/create/import/manual-code>`__.
#. `Import your database </acquia-cloud/create/import/manual-db>`__.
#. `Import your user-uploaded
   files </acquia-cloud/create/import/manual-files>`__.
