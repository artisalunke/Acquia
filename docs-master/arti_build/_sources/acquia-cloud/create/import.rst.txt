After your new subscription is created on |acquia-product:ac|, you can
import a Drupal application into your new application's
|acquia-product:ac| environments. There are several ways to import a
Drupal application to |acquia-product:ac|, and the available options
vary depending on the size and complexity of your application.

To import your existing application into |acquia-product:ac|, select
from the following methods:

-  *`|acquia-product:ui| </acquia-cloud/create/import/archive-import>`__*
   - This works best for applications that aren't very large (website
   archive under 100MB in size).
-  *`|acquia-product:add| </acquia-cloud/create/import/devdesktop>`__* -
   This requires downloading and installing
   `|acquia-product:add| </dev-desktop>`__, which is available for
   Windows and macOS. It is otherwise simple and works well for
   applications both large and small.
-  *`Drush-based import process </acquia-cloud/create/import/drush>`__*
   - This requires comfort with Drush and other command-line tools, but
   works well for applications both large and small.

If none of these import methods works for you, you can use the `manual
import process </acquia-cloud/create/import/manual>`__, which works well
for applications both large and small, but requires familiarity with
source control and command line tools.
