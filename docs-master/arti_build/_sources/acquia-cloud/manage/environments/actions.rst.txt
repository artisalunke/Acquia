Filtering environments
----------------------

If you have many environments, you can use the **Filter Environments**
field on the **Applications > Environments** page to find the
environment that you want to work with.

Start typing in the **Filter Environments** field; only environments
whose names match your filter string will be displayed on the
Environments page. Clear the **Filter Environments** field to display
all of the environments of your application.

within an application.

To rename an environment, complete the following steps:

#. On the **Overview** page, click **Rename**.
#. Enter a new name for the environment.
#. Click **Rename**.
