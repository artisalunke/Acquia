The **Environments** page for an application displays each of the
application's `environments </acquia-cloud/glossary#environment>`__.
For each environment, it displays controls and information about the
environment's code, databases, and files.

About environments
------------------

|acquia-product:ac| uses separate environments in order to help you
maintain a clear and orderly workflow as you develop, test, and publish
your applications. An application is deployed on each of its
environments, but each environment may be in a different state, with its
own database and possibly a different code branch or tag deployed. Each
environment has a URL at which its application can be viewed, but only
the Production environment's URL is designed to be visible to the
application's users (website visitors).

How many environments your application has depends on the level of your
Acquia subscription.

Managing environments
---------------------

On an application's **Environments** page, click the name of an
environment to display its **Overview** page. From the **Overview** page
for an environment, you can:

-  `Manage your code </acquia-cloud/develop/code>`__, including
   switching the tag or branch deployed on the environment, or deploying
   a tag or branch from a different environment.
-  `Manage your databases </acquia-cloud/manage/database>`__, including
   backing up and restoring databases, and copying databases from a
   different environment.
-  `Manage your files </acquia-cloud/manage/files>`__, including copying
   files from a different environment.
-  `Configure the environment </acquia-cloud/manage/configure>`__,
   including PHP settings, production mode, and more.
-  `Clear the Varnish cache </acquia-cloud/performance/varnish#clear>`__
   for the environment.
-  Make a `fresh Drupal installation </acquia-cloud/create/install>`__
   in the environment, overwriting your existing application code and
   database.
-  Activate `Live Development </acquia-cloud/develop/livedev>`__ mode
   for an environment.
-  `Rename </acquia-cloud/manage/environments/actions#rename>`__ the
   environment.
-  Understand your **Site health** by using `Uptime
   monitoring </acquia-cloud/manage/uptime>`__.
