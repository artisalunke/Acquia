   determined in accordance with the Subscription tier purchased by the
   Customer, as indicated in the Order and detailed in section 2.

   #. **Diagnosis Support**

      Diagnosis support entitles the Customer to engage Acquia in the
      diagnosis of the |acquia-product:edg| platform and Drupal
      functionality issues during the development or operation of the
      Customer’s website(s) on the |acquia-product:edg| platform. Acquia
      will identify and diagnose the root cause of such reported issue
      and provide the Customer with recommendations for repair to be
      implemented by the Customer. Diagnosis support includes support
      issues with the following:

      -  Site Factory Platform administration features and configuration
      -  Website(s) configuration and per-website theme configuration
      -  Website(s) not operating as expected in the
         |acquia-product:edg| platform Drupal instance

      Customer customizations to Drupal core files may limit Acquia's
      ability to diagnosis issues. Acquia may recommend or require the
      Customer to remove such customizations and replace them with
      alternate solutions using standard Drupal core and contributed
      modules, or other standard, published core patches. Furthermore,
      diagnosis support may be limited with modified Drupal contributed
      modules, certain integrations, or custom modules. Substitutions
      may be recommended by Acquia but are made at the sole discretion
      of the Customer. Diagnosis support does not include assistance
      with the installation, configuration, maintenance, or
      troubleshooting of other applications which the Customer has
      installed on its website(s). Acquia reserves the right to disable
      any non-supported applications to troubleshoot Drupal issues.
      Acquia may require the Customer to upgrade to a later or more
      stable release of a Drupal module or component for Acquia to
      continue with the diagnosis of an issue.

   2.1 **Factory Stacks** |br| 
    Factory Stacks can be added to |acquia-product:edg| subscriptions. Each Factory Stack includes its own page views/month, maximum number of websites, and Drupal support tickets (as described in the previous table). Entitlements are not shared across Factory Stacks in a single |acquia-product:edg| subscription.

   2.2 **Elite** |br| 
    As an optional add-on, any of the subscription tiers mentioned in this section can be upgraded to an Elite level. This will change the entitlements for the subscription as follows:

    +--------------------------+--------------+
    | Entitlement              |              |
    +==========================+==============+
    | Drupal Support Tickets   | Unlimited    |
    +--------------------------+--------------+
    | Advisory Hours           | 16           |
    +--------------------------+--------------+
    | Critical Response SLA    | 30 min, 24x7 |
    +--------------------------+--------------+
    | Search queries/year      | 50M          |
    +--------------------------+--------------+
    | Search docs indexed/year | 500K         |
    +--------------------------+--------------+

   2.3 **Platform Services** |br| 
      Acquia will maintain the Customer’s website(s) on the
      |acquia-product:edg| platform during the Subscription Term. Acquia
      will use commercially reasonable efforts to prevent unauthorized
      access to the servers hosting the Customer’s website(s) and will
      promptly notify the Customer of any known security breaches. The
      Customer may submit an unlimited number of support requests
      related to the |acquia-product:edg| platform, and as long as the
      root cause of the requests demonstrate that the issues are due to
      the |acquia-product:edg| platform and not the Customer’s
      website(s), those tickets will not be counted towards Customer’s
      support ticket allotment.

   2.4 **Data Centers** |br| 
      The |acquia-product:edg| platform utilizes an infrastructure that
      is physically remote from Acquia’s office facilities. A disaster
      affecting one or more of Acquia's offices would not impact the
      availability of Customer websites or the security of Customer
      data. The |acquia-product:edg| environment consists of major
      Regions and Availability Zones. Availability Zones are separate,
      yet interconnected, data centers in major Regions in Acquia’s
      global infrastructure. The |acquia-product:edg| platform utilizes
      a highly available, redundant architecture that distributes
      replicated redundant server types (load balancing, caching, web
      and database servers) across multiple Availability Zones in the
      same Region. In the event that service in Customer's assigned
      Availability Zone (or Region) is severely impacted, Acquia will
      use commercially reasonable efforts to restore the services in an
      alternate Availability Zone in the same Region.

   2.5 **Backups** |br| 
      Acquia will maintain a comprehensive backup solution which
      includes, without limitation, website code, static assets/files,
      and databases. Acquia will automatically export MYSQL database one
      time per day and retain these backups for three days. At the
      Drupal code layer, Customer-developed code may be managed and
      deployed by the Customer using Acquia’s Git code repository
      service for |acquia-product:edg| PaaS subscriptions. This service
      allows for roll back and re-deployment of Drupal code, effectively
      backing up the Drupal layer so that the website's code can be
      redeployed to a new web server instance as needed. In addition,
      Acquia conducts daily backups of website(s) files and maintains a
      complete and current copy of each website that will be used in the
      event the website must be restored by Acquia due to failure of the
      Service. These backups are performed as follows:

      -  Daily over the previous week
      -  Weekly over the previous month
      -  Monthly thereafter.

   2.6 **Disaster Recovery** |br| 
      The |acquia-product:edg| platform will make hourly internal
      disaster recovery snapshots of Customer data. Acquia will retain
      these snapshots on a diminishing schedule for three months. These
      backups will be used to restore Customer website(s) at another
      location in the same Region in the event of a total data center
      loss or a loss of multiple disk systems. Acquia will not provide
      the Customer access to these backups, and will not use these
      snapshots to restore website(s) due to data-loss or deletion by
      Customer.

   2.7 **Emergency Capacity** |br| 
      In the event that Acquia becomes aware that the Customer’s
      |acquia-product:edg| platform becomes (or may become) overloaded
      due to greater than normal usage, in an effort to maintain website
      performance Acquia will notify the Customer and will take
      reasonable actions to increase the server capacity. The Customer
      agrees that Acquia, in its reasonable discretion, can unilaterally
      add capacity up to three times the contracted capacity, and such
      additional capacity will remain provisioned for a minimum of five
      calendar days. Such additional capacity will be billed based on
      Acquia’s then current pricing per 1,000 page views, and per
      website over Customer’s allotted coverage for page views and
      websites set forth in the Customer’s Order. Acquia will also make
      reasonable efforts to contact the Customer when it is determined a
      server upgrade is required. Acquia reserves the right to not
      provision additional server capacity if the Customer has any
      outstanding amounts due, or if it determines that additional
      capacity is unlikely to significantly improve performance,
      including, without limitation, when the overload is caused by an
      error in the Customer's software (for example, PHP code), the
      Customer’s configuration of the |acquia-product:edg| platform,
      |acquia-product:edg| platform Drupal instance, Customer Drupal
      instance or during a denial-of-service attack. Acquia reserves the
      right to bill the Customer for traffic associated with a
      denial-of-service attack.

   2.8 **Page Views** |br| 
      For |acquia-product:edg| platform management and billing purposes,
      Page Views shall be calculated as the number of requests that are
      made to the Customer’s application on the |acquia-product:edg|
      server(s) as may be counted by Acquia through industry standard
      means, which may include one or more of the following: applicable
      logs, CDN forwarded requests, trackers on Customer’s application
      for machine and other traffic, or as may otherwise be reasonably
      determined by Acquia.

   2.9 **Best Practices** |br| 
      The Customer understands that they are responsible to build
      applications and workflows according to both Drupal and
      |acquia-product:edg| best practices, unless otherwise understood
      and agreed by Acquia, including the following:

      -  Maintaining a configured PHP memory limit of no more than 256
         MB for each website
      -  Storing no more than 1000 files per filesystem directory, and
         totalling no more than an average of 5 GB of file storage per
         website
      -  Maintaining no more than 1s PHP response time as indicated in
         server logs

      For more information about best practices for your |acquia-product:edg| websites, see the `Acquia Cloud Site Factory product documentation </site-factory>`__ .

   2.10 **Excessive Burdens** |br| 
      The Customer represents that it will not place excessive burdens
      (as indicated by Drupal and |acquia-product:edg| best practices)
      on the |acquia-product:edg| platform’s CPUs, servers, or other
      resources, including customer support services. The Customer
      understands that bandwidth connection speeds and other similar
      indices of capacity are maximum numbers. Consistently reaching
      these capacity numbers and/or significant deviation from
      application best practices as indicated in section 2.9 may result
      in Acquia’s need to place restrictions on the Customer’s use of
      the |acquia-product:edg| platform services. The Customer further
      agrees that Acquia may place restrictions on the Customer’s use of
      the Services, including Support Services, to the extent they
      exceed the use of these resources for similarly situated
      customers.

   2.11 **Connector Module** |br| 
      The Customer agrees to keep the |acquia-product:edg| Connector
      module up-to-date, meaning no more than three (3) versions behind
      the latest stable version announced on `Acquia’s documentation
      website </>`__.
