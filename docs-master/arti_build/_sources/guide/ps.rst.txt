==========================================

**Last updated: September 5, 2017**

Acquia Professional Services provides implementation, workshop, and
speciality services for the Acquia Platform. Implementation services are
provided with a custom Statement of Work (SOW). Workshops and speciality

Workshops and Specialty Services
--------------------------------

Professional Services are subject to the applicable Order or SOW between
Customer and Acquia, the terms set forth herein, and the payment of all
applicable fees.

Customer acknowledges that Acquia’s ability to perform the Professional
Services depends upon Customer’s fulfillment of the following
obligations and project assumptions.

**Customer Responsibilities** - Customer shall:

a. provide overall management and business ownership with respect to the
   Professional Services
b. manage relationships with any third parties
c. promptly provide to Acquia any applicable documentation of existing
   requirements, designs, and constraints, as required to provide Acquia
   with the insight needed to support the provision of Professional
   Services
d. provide office space, phones, facilities, network connectivity, and
   computer systems for onsite Acquia personnel
e. provide timely access to key stakeholders, subject matter experts,
   and project team members for approvals, decisions, or other actions
   in connection with the performance of Acquia’s obligations under the
   SOW
f. obtain any Acquia subscriptions, consents, and/or third party
   licenses required to support the Professional Services
g. pre-install all required software and hardware prior to the
   commencement of any Professional Services
h. if applicable, Customer will make all web site content and
   application data available in electronic form and on the schedule
   required by Acquia to complete the Professional Services in a timely
   fashion

Professional Services do not include any associated costs with
provisioning hardware for Customer. In the event a server is required
for the performance of Professional Services, Customer agrees to pay
Acquia the associated hardware costs at Acquia's then current list
price.

**Change Management** - Revisions to the scope of the Professional
Services described in an SOW shall be handled through a change order.
Acquia will have no obligation to begin work on any change order that
has not been approved and executed by each party.

**Performance** - Any tasks identified in an SOW are intended merely to
describe a resource plan only and the scope of work that may be provided
by Acquia. Acquia will provide only those services as directed and
requested by Customer and only as time allows. Acquia will use good
faith efforts to complete the services described in an SOW and does not
guarantee that such services will be completed within the allotted hours
or days set forth in an SOW or otherwise approved by Customer pursuant
to a change order. Any delay in Acquia’s performance that is caused by
Customer or a third party not under Acquia’s control will result in an
extension of the applicable estimated timeframe, with a commensurate
extension of the time and fees required.

**Rescheduling** - Customer may, without penalty, reschedule the
Professional Services with a minimum of two (2) weeks advance written
notice to Acquia. Once the Acquia team has been scheduled with Customer,
should Customer provide Acquia with less than two (2) weeks advance
notice of Customer's request to reschedule the Professional Services,
Customer will be charged rescheduling fee equal to 50% of the Fees set
forth in the SOW (the "Rescheduling Fee") plus, if applicable, any
travel expenses already incurred by Acquia. Acquia may waive the
Rescheduling Fee if Acquia is able to redeploy the Acquia team to
another engagement during the originally scheduled Professional Services
period.
