Technical Account Manager Product Guide
=======================================

**Last updated: November 2, 2016**

#. **Technical Account Manager**

   Customers with an |acquia-product:ace| Premium Elite subscription
   and/or |acquia-product:edg| Elite subscription may add a Technical
   Account Manager (TAM) to their Subscription for an additional fee.
   Team TAM Subscriptions include access to a team of three to four
   Technical Account Managers supporting a group of customers. Customers
   with a Named TAM Subscription are provided with a TAM who support an
   average of six customers per TAM, and Global TAMs typically support
   two to three customers per TAM.

   #. **In-scope Activities**

      TAMs will provide Customers with guidance, best practices,
      training, recommendations and/or consultation on the development,
      deployment or operation of Drupal, and for |acquia-product:edg|
      Elite Subscriptions, the general creation, deployment, and
      operation of the website(s) on the |acquia-product:edg| Platform.
      Depending upon the nature of the request, these activities may be
      delivered by the TAM or by another Acquia resource under the
      guidance of the TAM. Examples of TAM advice and guidance include:

      -  Convey best practices, including mentoring for proper team
         composition, discovery, project planning, development
         techniques, integration, deployment and ongoing operations.
      -  Mitigate risks of project planning, development, and deployment
         by acting as a central Drupal expert resource working with
         Customer stakeholders and selected development partner(s).
      -  Provide ad-hoc guidance during development and deployment
         including Drupal architecture, module selection, integration of
         Drupal APIs, performance tuning, scalability, security etc.
      -  Develop deep understanding of application so Acquia can provide
         optimal support during development, deployment and operations.

   #. **Onsite Visits**

      If ordered by Customer under a Named TAM or Global TAM
      Subscription, the TAM may meet onsite with Customer up to one day
      per quarter (one day per month for Global TAM). Travel and
      expenses for each visit is included with Customer’s Subscription.
      Any additional travel and expenses are billable. Any additional
      travel and expenses shall be invoiced to Customer in accordance
      with the Agreement.

   #. **Out-of-scope Activities**

      TAMs are expert-level advisors and guides to Drupal and Acquia’s
      products and services. TAMs are not development resources and thus
      certain activities are out of scope for TAM:

      -  Write code, or modify existing code of any kind: including but
         not limited to any code in a website codebase, webpage
         authoring, shell scripts, or utility scripts.
      -  Build or modify Drupal websites for Customer, including but not
         limited to module installation, website building through the
         Drupal UI, website administration or configuration, content
         authoring, editing, or administration.
      -  Install, maintain, or configure software on Customer-maintained
         infrastructure.
      -  Work on-site at a Customer’s business, outside of onsite visits
         described above.
      -  Act as first responders for website emergencies. Customers
         should open a Critical issue with Global Support as a first
         measure in an emergency.

   #. **Application Assurances**

      TAMs will provide Application Assurances purchased by Customer, as
      indicated in the Order.

   #. **Semiannual Assurances**

      TAMs will conduct two Application Assurances, each on a single
      Drupal website, during the twelve month period covered under the
      Customer’s order. For each Assurance, Customer will arrange
      scheduling with TAM, and select which website will be the subject
      of the Assurance.

   #. **Quarterly Assurances**

      TAMs will conduct four Application Assurances, each on a single
      Drupal website, during the twelve month period covered under the
      Customer’s order. For each Assurance, Customer will arrange
      scheduling with TAM, and select which website will be the subject
      of the Assurance.

   #. **Application Assurance Description**

      For each Application Assurance, Acquia will conduct a set of
      automated and manual Drupal application and stack investigations
      to gauge critical health metrics for the website selected by the
      Customer. At the conclusion of the review, Acquia will provide a
      written Application Assurance report with findings of the review,
      along with recommendations that may improve website security,
      performance, and scalability. Acquia will provide the report
      within two weeks of the completion of the assurance. At Customer’s
      request, Acquia will review the report results with Customer so
      the Customer is aware of the business risks and understands the
      technical suggestions.

      Application Assurances are conducted remotely, and can only be
      applied to Drupal websites hosted on |acquia-product:ac| or
      |acquia-product:edg|.

      Assurance health metric categories and potential areas for
      recommendations include (but are not limited to):
      Commonly-exploited security vectors; Site Performance; Hardware
      utilization/capacity; Traffic analysis.
