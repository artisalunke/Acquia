Acquia will provide the services described below only if purchased by Customer, as indicated in the Order.

#. **Multi-Region Replication With Failover**

   Customer is responsible for performing the failover upon Acquia’s
   recommendation during a Region outage. Customer may be required to
   implement Acquia recommended application changes to ensure optimal
   Multi Region Service and support. Customer must provide Acquia with
   at least five business days advance notice before electing to add an
   additional Code Base to this service.
