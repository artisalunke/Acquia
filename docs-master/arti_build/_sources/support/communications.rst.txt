Support Communications
======================

Acquia Support will notify customers about the following types of
events:

.. note:: Although we make every reasonable effort to limit our communications
          only to customers who are directly affected by an issue, depending on
          the scope and urgency of an issue, we may choose to use multiple
          communications channels to reach as many of our customers as quickly as
          possible.

-  **Scheduled maintenance**

   `Scheduled maintenance </support/guide#platform_maintenance>`__
   actions are planned maintenance actions (such as |acquia-product:ac|
   releases, |acquia-product:edg| releases, or other routine
   maintenance) that are required to ensure that your application
   remains secure and performative. Scheduled maintenance actions are
   typically communicated using email, although you may also receive
   these maintenance notices as a ticket. Scheduled maintenance is often
   performed between 11:00pm and 7:00am local time to your hosting
   region in an attempt to minimize impact to you and your website
   visitors.

-  **Unscheduled maintenance**

   Unscheduled maintenance is urgent maintenance that must be performed
   to ensure the security or performance of your application. This
   maintenance may begin immediately after a security vulnerability is
   announced or if your instance becomes impaired and requires
   maintenance to return it to its optimal functionality. If unscheduled
   maintenance is required for the entire platform, it will be
   communicated by updates to
   `status.acquia.com <http://status.acquia.com>`__ or by email. If
   unscheduled maintenance is required to address a specific impairment
   to the instances support your application, you will be notified using
   a Support ticket. For some unscheduled maintenance events, especially
   critical security events, we will act first, then notify as quickly
   as possible.

-  **Product changes or improvements**

   Product improvements or changes typically occur when Acquia
   implements changes to the method by which customers interact with
   their applications, either with the |acquia-product:anw| interface,
   |acquia-product:add|, or terminal access, or when Acquia implements
   improvements to specific Acquia products (such as
   |acquia-product:cha| or |acquia-product:cf|). These changes are
   typically scheduled 30 to 90 days in advance to ensure that customers
   have sufficient time to make any required changes to take advantage
   of these improvements.

   The channel that is used to communicate a change depends on the
   length of the campaign, the number of customers involved, and the
   impact that the change will have on application functionality or the
   |acquia-product:anw| interface. Such changes will often accompany an
   |acquia-product:ac| release; in such cases, customers will be
   notified in the |acquia-product:ac| release notes and release
   notifications. Customers may additionally be notified about specific
   changes or improvements by email, a Support ticket, or direct
   outreach from their Account Manager or Technical Account Manager.
   Customers will receive no fewer than two notifications regarding such
   a change.

-  **End-of-life (EOL) campaigns**

   EOL campaigns focus on efforts to ensure that all components of the
   |acquia-product:ac| platform, Acquia products and product features,
   and other Acquia services remain secure, supported, and up-to-date to
   provide Acquia customers the performance benefits of emerging cloud
   technologies. Obsolete platform components may impact site
   performance or security and can require changes to customer
   applications when retired. These campaigns typically span three to
   six months to allow us to work with customers to ensure that
   application impact is minimized, and the timing of the changes are
   scheduled to allow customers sufficient time to make any necessary
   changes to their applications. During EOL campaigns, customers should
   expect to be contacted several times across many communication
   channels, including (but not limited to) an announcement on our
   `Software end-of-life schedule </support/eol>`__, articles on the
   Acquia |acquia-product:lib|, email notices, Twitter promotion
   campaigns, Support tickets, and direct outreach from their Account
   Manager, Technical Account manager, or Acquia Support staff.

-  **Holidays**

   Customers will be notified one week prior to any office closures due
   to `local or regional holidays <support/holidays>`__. Customers will
   receive notices based on their Support region (Europe/Africa/Middle
   East, Asia Pacific/Japan, or the Americas) indicating the Acquia
   resources that are available for Critical request responses during
   the office closure. All other resources should be considered
   unavailable until the appropriate regional office reopens.

Acquia communication channels
-----------------------------

Acquia uses several communication channels to reach customers, and may
use them in conjunction depending upon the nature and urgency of the
message. This includes, but is not limited to, the following:

-  **status.acquia.com**

   We post updates about outages and availability at status.acquia.com.
   `Sign up there </support/status>`__ to automatically be notified
   about platform-wide issues.

-  **Support tickets**

   By default, roles with the **Include as a collaborator on all help
   requests by default** permission will be copied on all new Support
   tickets. To provide a team member a new or additional role, or more
   detail on editing roles to assign permissions, see `Working with
   roles and permissions </acquia-cloud/teams/roles>`__ for
   instructions.

-  **Twitter**

   The `@acquia_support <https://twitter.com/acquia_support>`__ account
   broadcasts information about platform-wide issues and answers general
   questions from Acquiaâ€™s customers. Critical, time-sensitive, or
   detailed questions should be directed to Support tickets.

-  **EOL calendar**

   Acquia lists anticipated product, service, and technology end-of-life
   dates for Acquia's products on the `Support end-of-life
   calendar </support/eol>`__.
