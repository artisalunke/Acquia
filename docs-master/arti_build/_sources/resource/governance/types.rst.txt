Governance is involved with many aspects of business and technical
management. When gathering requirements for a platform project, your
organization should ensure that the following portions of governance are
clearly discussed and outlined:

-  `Brand​ ​governance​ <#brand-governance>`__ - Ensures consistency in managing
   your brand promise across multiple channels, encouraging user
   awareness, engagement, retention, and loyalty.
-  `Content​ ​governance​ <#content-governance>`__ - Establishes standards for
   how your organization communicates with its audience across channels.
-  `Platform​ and feature​ ​governance <#platform-and-feature-governance>`__ ​- Establishes
   how your organization works across functional areas, brands, and
   markets to manage innovation on your platform.
-  `Code​ ​governance​ <#code-governance>`__ – Establishes standards and
   processes for management of the software development life cycle on
   your platform.

Brand governance
----------------

You should consider the following aspects of brand governance when
developing your policies:

-  *Brand ownership* - Develop a brand strategy that establishes
   consistency, identify the brand owner who will ensure consistency
   across channels, and establish brand stewards to provide additional
   advice and guidance.
-  *Brand standards* - Create clear and available guidelines (such as a
   brand book for styling and assets) that are flexible and take into
   account the differing markets and objectives of the covered brands.
-  *Brand tools* - Select a content management system to establish a
   consistent look and feel, define style guides and editorial guides
   for clear communication, and establish an asset management system
   (such as |damlink|_) to ensure consistent use of
   digital assets across properties.


.. |damlink| replace:: \ |acquia-product:dam|\ 
.. _damlink: /dam

You can use Drupal’s features, such as views and base themes, to enforce
layout and styling.

Content governance
------------------

Consider the following aspects of content governance when developing
your policies to ensure that they are engaging, persuasive, and
consistent:

-  *Content ownership* - Define roles for creating, maintaining, and
   approving content, and develop a content strategy with
   representatives of your marketing, legal, and product teams.
-  *Content standards* - Create and maintain guidelines for the types of
   content your brands will produce, and their style, voice, and tone.
   Establish processes for auditing and reviewing the content during and
   after creation.
-  *Content tools* - Configure your content management system to handle
   content approval workflows, ensure consistency, and measure audience
   engagement with your content.

Drupal’s workflows can help you enforce any legal, regulatory, or
marketing approval processes needed for your content. Drupal’s taxonomy
system allows you to organize, classify, and cross-reference related
pieces of content.

Platform and feature governance
-------------------------------

Be sure to consider the following aspects of platform and feature
governance when developing your policies, which can allow your platform
scales in an agile, effective, and cost-conscious manner:

-  *Platform ownership* - Identify your platform owner, and your
   technical and marketing stakeholders. Support adoption,
   collaboration, and best practices by establishing committees for key
   areas.
-  *Platform standards* - Develop resource models and processes for
   agile development, release management, and feature requests.
-  *Platform tools* - Adopt tools for managing websites and content
   across brands and markets, sharing and repurposing content, managing
   releases, and managing feature requests.

In Drupal, leveraging a common base distribution, such as
|acquia-product:ld|, enables you to build websites that inherit a
shared, stable code base while layering theming unique to each brand or
region. |acquia-product:edg| can help you manage large numbers of
related websites, and |acquia-product:ch| can help you manage
centralized, reusable content across multiple websites.

Code governance
---------------

You should consider the following aspects of code governance when
developing standards and processes for the software development life
cycle of your platform:

-  *Code ownership* - Identify the owner of your code, and establish
   teams that will own specific platform components.
-  *Code standards* - Develop processes for feature requests, agile
   development, and release management. Enforce best practices of code
   management.
-  *Code tools* - Identify and use industry-standard tools for work
   requests, project management, task prioritization, quality assurance,
   and unit testing. Automate code management steps to reduce the
   occurrences of human error.

Using |bltlink|_ and a common base
distribution of Drupal (such as |ldlink|_)
can help you streamline and simplify your code governance needs.

.. |ldlink| replace:: \ |acquia-product:ld|\ 
.. _ldlink: /lightning

.. |bltlink| replace:: \ |acquia-product:blt|\ 
.. _bltlink: /devtools/blt

On the next page, you'll learn about the 
`different models you can use </resources/governance/models>`__ to put these 
types of governance in place.
