It is important to ensure that your platform governance strategy does
not lose track of websites on your platform after they have been
launched. Long-term platform success depends not only on a successful
launch, but also with training_, testing_, ongoing maintenance_, and 
future enhancements_.

Planning for documentation and training
---------------------------------------

When building a platform, the expense and time needed to create platform
training and documentation are often overlooked. Having many users on
many different websites in a shared platform calls for more extensive
and detailed documentation and training than is needed for a single
website.

Review the following questions to consider as part of building your
governance plan:

-  What is the scope of the required training and documentation?
-  How many individuals and teams need to be trained, and how frequently
   will this training need to be refreshed?
-  Who will produce training and documentation materials, and how will
   they be managed?
-  How will training be delivered? Will it be managed in a central
   location, or will it be handled on a per-department or per-manager
   basis?
-  How will you manage documentation and training updates for websites
   that differ from one another on a feature level?

Planning for testing and demo profile management
------------------------------------------------

Your demo website or profile is typically where you and your users will
test features and functionality, and can be used for user acceptance
testing, automated testing, and training. Your governance plans should
account for how this profile will be maintained and used, based on the
following questions:

-  How will your organization use your demo website or profile?
-  What role, if any, does the demo website or profile need for training
   internal staff?
-  What role, if any, will the demo website or profile have with
   automated testing?
-  What role, if any, will the demo website or profile have with user
   acceptance testing of new features?

Planning for platform maintenance
---------------------------------

Platform maintenance is the necessary, periodic work that needs to be
performed on your completed platform to keep it functioning as
originally designed. When you are creating your platform governance
strategy, it is important to allocate time and resources for the
post-launch needs of your properties and the platform on which they
reside. Some questions you should consider when planning include the
following:

-  Who will maintain your platform and its properties? Will maintenance
   be handled in-house, or by a third party?
-  Do the intended maintainers currently have the technical knowledge to
   perform the needed work? If not, how will this knowledge gap be
   addressed?
-  Are budget allocations for platform maintenance and platform
   enhancement separate or combined?
-  How will bug fixes be prioritized?
-  How will emergencies discovered outside of business hours be handled?

routine Drupal administration tasks, which can allow your team to focus
on completing other high-value tasks, including platform enhancements.

Planning for platform enhancements
----------------------------------

Unlike platform maintenance, platform enhancements are forward-looking
plans to improve your platform by adding new features, improving current
functionality, or resolving technical debt. You should consider the
intended lifespan of the software packages on which your platform
relies, including removing any reliance on software as it approaches
end-of-life.

The following questions can help you refine your platform enhancement
plans:

-  Are budget allocations for platform maintenance and platform
   enhancement separate or combined?
-  Will platform enhancements be performed by the same team that
   performs platform maintenance? If yes, how will their time be
   allocated between the two projects?
-  Does the team creating platform enhancements currently have the
   business knowledge to correctly assess your organizationâ€™s future
   needs? If not, who can advise them?
-  Does the team creating platform enhancements have the technical
   knowledge to create and implement upcoming platform enhancements? If
   not, how will this gap be addressed?
