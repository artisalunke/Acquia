Lesson Goal

.. container:: message-status

   Create an area to display the right content to a particular segment of your audience.

Begin this lesson by installing:

-  `Google Chrome <https://www.google.com/chrome/>`__
-  `Copy CSS
   Selector <https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/copy-css-selector/kemkenbgbgodoglfkkejbdcpojnodnkg?hl=en>`__

A slot is an area on your website configured to display targeted content
and A/B Tests. You may create a slot around a hero banner, call to
action, or even the entire page. Following our example, we will create a
slot to place our hero banner from the Publishing Content to
|acquia-product:leb| lesson.

|Part 1 of instructions|

#. Sign in to your website as an administrative user.
#. `Set up and activate your access </lift/exp-builder/access>`__ to |acquia-product:leb|.
#. With **Create** highlighted in the top menu bar, click the **Slots**
   tab.
#. |acquia-product:leb| shows a list of the available slots on the
   displayed page if applicable.
#. Click the **Create new slot** button to create a slot for our hero
   banner.
#. In the **Slot Name** field, enter a name that describes this slot's
   purpose. Enter “Homepage Hero Banner” to continue with our example.
#. In the **Slot Pages** field, enter the paths for the pages where you
   want this slot to display, one page per line.

   -  |acquia-product:leb| displays the domain of the applicable
      |acquia-product:lpm| running above the **Slot Pages** field. By
      default, this field displays the path of the page that you are
      currently visiting

#. Click **Create Slot**
#. Choose an area of the page to personalize. Following our example,
   this should be the homepage banner or **Hero** block.
#. `Using the Copy CSS selector Chrome extension, generate a selector
   for this piece of
   content. <https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=8&v=zlzgoVnh3HQ>`__
#. Copy the CSS selector to your clipboard, and paste it into the CSS
   Selectors Field.
#. Click **Save**.

#. A blue line outlining the area of the page where your Slot has been
