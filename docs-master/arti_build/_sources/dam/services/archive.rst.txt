  This is an add-on feature. Contact your Account Manager to add this
  feature to your subscription.

*The information on this page applies only to users that have
`*Admin* </dam/admin/users#role>`__ or
`*Contributor* </dam/admin/users#role>`__ role type permissions.*

Archival storage allows you to store and manage your rarely-used files,
while keeping them organized, close-at-hand, and easy to find and
access.

Assets that are archived are inactive — therefore not viewable
in|acquia-product:bc| — and will display an archive icon |Archive icon|
on the asset thumbnail. After an asset is archived, users cannot
download the asset until it is unarchived (which typically takes
approximately 24 hours).

.. admonition:: Notes

  -  Metadata cannot be added to archived assets.
  -  By default, only assets that are not archived will show up in search
     results. However, you can filter for archived assets.
