No more broken design links! When you use the |acquia-product:dam|
Connector for Adobe Creative Cloud, all of the files linked to your
design are available to anyone with |acquia-product:dam|. (Access
depends on having permission to the folder(s) containing the assets.)
This also reduces file size because there is no need to embed images.

For an overview of the Connector, see `Connector for Adobe Creative
Cloud </dam/services/cc>`__.

.. note::
  |acquia-product:dam| Connector for Adobe Creative Cloud is an add-on
  feature. If you want to add this to your |acquia-product:dam|
  subscription, `contact Acquia Support </support#contact>`__ for
  additional information.

   is no need to package the file, because all of your links will pull
   linked files directly from |acquia-product:dam|.

Additional information on using the |acquia-product:dam| Connector in InDesign
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The |acquia-product:dam| Connector lets you drag and drop images from
|acquia-product:dam| into InDesign to create direct, URL-based links.

In addition to the previously-described functionality, you may also do
the following:

*Update resolution* - Double-click the assets icon |Assets| in the links
panel to toggle between-low res and high-res assets. You can update all
links at once by pressing **Option** (MacOS) or **Alt** (Windows) as you
double-click the assets icon |Assets|.

*Updating version* - If a new version of an asset has been added in
|acquia-product:dam|, the warning icon |Warning| will be displayed in
the Links panel. Double-click the icon to update to the latest version.

|Changed image|

*Moving assets in |acquia-product:dam|* - There will be no impact on the
links if an asset used in the InDesign document is moved in
|acquia-product:dam|.

If you need to distribute an InDesign to someone who does not have
|acquia-product:dam|, you can use the InDesign Package command with the
option to include copies of the assets from |acquia-product:dam| in the
output file.
