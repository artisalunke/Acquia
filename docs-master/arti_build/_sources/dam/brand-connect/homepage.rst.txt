Configure elements
------------------

Now you’re ready to configure. The elements are on the left:

-  `Carousel <#carousel>`__
-  `Folder <#folder>`__
-  `Lightbox <#lightbox>`__
-  `Other page elements <#other>`__

Carousel
~~~~~~~~

The carousel rotates a group of images. When you add multiple assets, it
acts as an image slider. Drag and drop the **Carousel** icon |Carousel
icon| into the page to add image assets with titles and descriptions.

When users click images displayed in a carousel on your homepage, they
can either be taken to the asset details page for the clicked image (the
default behavior) or to the folder where that image is located. To set
the destination, select your desired **Link images to** option. These
options are **Asset Details** and **Folder**.

Carousel image tips:

-  For optimal display, make your carousel images 1,265x435 pixels.
-  If you want to add text over an image, add images to the carousel
   with the subject or focal point a little left or right of center.
-  The center of an image is the main focus, and resizing the carousel
   or viewing the homepage on a phone or tablet will crop the image
   around the center.

You may need to edit your images to fit these requirements.

Folder
~~~~~~

A folder must contain at least one image in order for it to display on
the homepage. The assets contained in this folder will be visible to all
users that can view your |acquia-product:bc| portal, but only users with
permissions can download them. To add a folder to your homepage:

#. Drag the folder icon |Folder icon| to the homepage.
#. Select the asset folder you’d like to add.
#. Click **Continue**.
#. On the **Select Folder Cover Images** page, choose up to four images
   to display on the cover. Click **Insert**. |Select folder images|
#. To reposition or zoom in or out on an image within the current frame,
   click the **Reposition** icon |Reposition icon| in the image. Click
   the **Check** icon |Check icon| to save changes or the **Cancel**
   icon |Cancel icon| to exit without saving changes. Use the slider
   along the bottom edge of the image to zoom in or out.
#. To move an image to a different frame, click the **Move** icon |<|
   and drag the image to the desired frame.
#. To edit the display name of the folder, select the text displayed in
   the top of the image editor, and enter the desired name. By default,
   the folder name is set as the display name.
#. When you’ve completed your adjustments, click **Preview** to preview
   your changes or **Publish** to push your changes live.

A short message will appear stating your homepage changes have been
published.

Lightbox
~~~~~~~~

A lightbox allows users to view a curated collection of assets. These
assets are visible to all users that can view your |acquia-product:bc|
portal, but only users with permissions can download them. To add a
lightbox:

#. Drag and drop the **Lightbox** icon |dam-icon-lightbox.png| onto your
   homepage.
#. Select the lightbox you'd like to add. Click **Continue**.
#. On the **Select Lightbox Cover Images** page, choose up to four
   images to display on the cover. Click **Insert**.
#. To select images and make adjustments, follow the instructions in the
   `Folder <#folder>`__ section.
#. Click **Preview** in the top bar, then click **Back** to go back to
   the editing screen.
#. When you’re ready to publish, click **Publish**.
