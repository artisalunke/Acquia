Desired presets
---------------

You can convert assets during the download process by selecting a
desired preset configured by the |acquia-product:dam| administrator or
by creating your own custom preset. To create a custom preset, complete
the following steps:

#. Choose **Custom** from the desired preset.
#. Select the **File Format** from the dropdown.
#. Enter values for the following fields, as needed:

   -  **Resolution**
   -  **Dimensions**
   -  **Color space**

   If any of the fields are left blank, the file will retain its
   original setting when downloaded.
#. To save the preset for future use, select the **Save these settings**
   check box, and then enter a name for the setting.

.. _requests:

Download requests
-----------------

Occasionally, your |acquia-product:dam| administrator may require users
to request access to download select assets. If you attempt to download
an asset that requires approval prior to downloading, you may be
prompted to submit a download request.
