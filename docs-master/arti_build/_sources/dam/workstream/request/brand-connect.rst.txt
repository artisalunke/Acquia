Adding request forms to |acquia-product:bc|
===========================================

Adding Request Forms to |acquia-product:bc| allows non-Workstream users
to submit requests. To do this, the form must be published to and made
available in a |acquia-product:bc| portal. See `Request
forms </dam/workstream/request>`__ for more information on how to create
them.

#. Click **Settings** in the left-hand panel.
#. **Who can submit**: By default, all **Logged In** user groups will
   have access to the request form.

      groups that should have access to this request form.
   -  **To remove groups**: Hover your mouse over the group name and

   complete request forms, the form must be published to a
   |acquia-product:bc| portal.

   -  Toggle the slider to the right to make the form available on the
      desired brand portal(s).

.. note::
  You must publish the form for it to display on the selected brand portal(s).
