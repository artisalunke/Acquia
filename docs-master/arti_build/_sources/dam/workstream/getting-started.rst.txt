Getting started with Workstream
===============================

This article covers the information you need to know to configure
Workstream for your team.

.. note::
  Workstream is a separate product from |acquia-product:dam|. To learn
  more about adding Workstream to your account, `contact Acquia
  Support </support#contact>`__.

Workstream access
-----------------

#. Choose which contributor groups have access to Workstream. These
   groups correspond to the groups that exist in your DAM.
#. If you’d like to create groups specifically for Workstream, you will
   need to create them in |acquia-product:dam|. Click here to `learn
   more about Configuring Users and Groups </dam/admin/users>`__.

Teams
-----

If you have `Projects </dam/workstream/projects>`__ or
`Tasks </dam/workstream/tasks>`__ that often require coordination
between the same set(s) of people, you can create **Teams** that allow
you to quickly send assets for approval to a group of
|acquia-product:dam| users without requiring you to enter each user
individually.

#. To create a **Team**, login to |acquia-product:dam|.
#. Click **Teams** in the top navigation and select **Teams** from the
   dropdown.
#. Click the ``(+)`` **Plus** icon to **Add a new team**.
#. Enter a team name and description if desired.
#. Click **Save**.
#. To add members to a team, click the number in the **User Count**
   column. In the dialogue box, add users in the **Add Users to this
   Team** field. |br|
   |Adding a user|
#. Click **Save**.

Assets
------

Check the box under the Assets section to make assets uploaded to a
project or task inactive, meaning they cannot be downloaded by any user
or viewed by end users (read more about `asset
statuses </dam/content/asset/status>`__). We suggest checking this box
to ensure assets in production aren’t accessed by unauthorized users.

#.  **Locally stored assets**: Assets that are added to a task or
    project and were not previously housed in your DAM, will appear in
    a folder titled **Workstream Assets**. By default, only admins will
    be able to view the **Workstream Assets** folder. Once the assets
    have been added to the DAM, they can be moved to other folders with
    the permissions of that folder applied.

    .. important::
       Do not delete or rename the Workstream Assets folder.

#. **DAM assets**: Assets that are added to a task or project from a
   folder in your DAM will remain in their original folder and will be
   accessible to those who have permissions to view and download them.

.. _statuses:

Task statuses
-------------

Task statuses are a way for users to provide updates on the status of a
particular task. Two of the task statuses can be customized to your
needs, while the others are static.

#. To edit the status name, click **Edit Title**.
#. To edit the color of a status, click the color preview swatch and
   select your desired color.
