About tasks
===========

Tasks are well-defined items of work that can be assigned to an
individual for completion. You can create standalone tasks (also known
as orphan tasks) – like updating the images on a brochure – or attach
them to a `Project </dam/workstream/projects>`__, which is usually
comprised of a series of tasks.

.. _create:

Creating tasks
--------------

Tasks are created when Workstream users complete a request form. (Read
more about `creating request forms </dam/workstream/request>`__.)

#. Sign in to Workstream.
#. Click **New Task**.
#. Click the plus icon ( **+** ) for the request form that you want to
   complete.
#. Only request forms that a user has permission to view will display.
#. Complete the form.
#. Click **Save for Later** to save a draft.
#. When finished, click **Submit** to create a new task.

A unique, numeric task ID will be assigned to your task. Task IDs are
located in the **ID** column on the task list page, or preceding the
name of the task on the **Task Details** page.

.. _edit:

Editing tasks
-------------

Tasks can be edited from the **Task details page**.

Administrators can view and edit all tasks. Contributors can view and
edit tasks they’ve created or been added to as a watcher or assignee. If
tasks are assigned to a project, contributors will only be able to view
the task if they have permission to access the project. For more
information about projects, see `Projects in
Workstream </dam/workstream/projects>`__.

#. Sign in to Workstream, and then click **Tasks**.
#. Select the task that you want to edit.

Assignee
--------

After a task is created, it’s important to assign it to the appropriate
user so they can begin their work. If a request form includes the
**Assignee** field, the requester may have already filled in the
assignee. We recommend that at least one Workstream user, typically a
project manager, be responsible for maintaining task assignments and due
dates.

#. On the task details page, point to the **Assigned To** section, and
   then click the options icon |Options|.
#. Click **Change Assignee**.
#. Enter the name or email address of the user, and then click the
   user's name when it appears in the list.
#. Click **Save**.

The assignee will be notified of the assignment.

.. _contact:

Contact Assignee
----------------

You may want to send a personalized message to an assignee if you update
or change task requirements.

#. On the task details page, point to the **Assigned To** section and
   click the |Options| **Options** icon.
#. Click **Contact Assignee**. **Contact Assignee** will only display if
   the task is assigned to someone other than yourself.
#. Enter the message and then click **Send**.

.. _duedate:

Due Date
--------

If a request form includes the **Due Date** field, a requester may have
already assigned a due date to the task. Similar to assigning a task,
Acquia recommends at least one Workstream user, typically a project
manager, be responsible for maintaining due dates.

#. On the task details page, point to the **Due** section and click the
   |Options| **Options** icon.
#. Click **Change Due Date**.
#. Enter the date and time that the task is due, and then click
   **Save**.

.. _taskinfo:

Task name and description
-------------------------

#. On the **Task Details** page, point to the task name or description,
   and then click to inline edit.
#. Click anywhere on the page to save.
   A confirmation pop-up will appear in the lower-right corner of the
   screen.

Status
------

Task statuses are a way for users to provide updates on the status of a
particular task.

#. In the task details page, click the status. You can also point to the
   task name in the **Task Details** page or the task list, click the
   |Options| **Options** icon and select **Change Status**.
#. Click the dropdown, select the new status, and then click **Save**.
   |Change Status|

Watchers
--------

Watchers receive notifications if the following changes or updates are
made to a task:

#. A new task is added to a project you’re watching.
#. A task is assigned/reassigned.
#. A project is created from a task you’re watching.
#. The project sponsor changes.
#. A task is completed.
#. The launch date is changed.

In the task details page, point to the **Watchers** section and click
the |Options| **Options** icon.

.. _addwatcher:

Adding a watcher
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

#. Click **Add Watchers**.
#. Enter the name or email address of the user. Click the user's name
   when it appears in the list.
#. Enter an optional message.
#. Click **Save**.

.. _deletewatcher:

Deleting a watcher
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To delete a watcher, point to the watcher’s name, and then click the
**X** icon.

|Remove a watcher|

You can add yourself as a watcher by clicking **Watch Task**. Remove
yourself by clicking **Stop Watching**.

.. _contact-watchers:

Contacting watchers
-------------------

If there is an update or change to the task requirements, you can send a
personalized message to all watchers by completing the following steps:

#. In the task list, point to the task name and click the |Options|
   **Options** icon.
#. Click **Contact Watchers**. **Contact Watchers** will only display if
   there is a watcher listed other than yourself.
#. Enter the message.
#. Click **Send**.

.. _deliver:

Deliver to
----------

Use this section to note who the assignee should deliver task to. By
default, the task is set to be delivered to the creator of the task. To
change who the task should be delivered to, complete the following
steps:

#. Point to the deliver to section, and then click the options icon
   |Options|.
#. Enter the name or email address of the user, and then click their
   name in the list.
#. Click **Save**.

Checklist
---------

Task assignees and other interested parties can add items to the
checklist. The checklist can be used to break the task into smaller
steps or as a to-do list. Completing or checking off items on the
checklist does not affect the progress/completion percentage of a task
or project.

#. In the task details page, point to the checklist section and click
   the icon.
#. Click **Add an item** to edit/add information to the checklist.
#. Click **Save** when done.
#. When a checklist item is completed, check the box next to it.

   |Checklists in your DAM|

Keywords
--------

Keywords entered into this section will automatically be appended to any
new asset that is added to the **Assets** section of a task from
anywhere other than your DAM. Keywords will not be applied to assets
that you assign to the task from your DAM.

If a request form includes the **Keywords** field, a requester may have
already entered keywords.

#. In the **Keywords** section of the **Task Details** page, click
   **Enter a new keyword**, and then enter the keyword.
#. Click ``Tab`` or ``Enter`` to create a new keyword. You can also add
   a comma after the term to add it as a keyword.
#. To remove a keyword, click the ``(X)`` next to it.

.. note::
  Removing a keyword is not retroactive. It will prevent that keyword from
  being added to new assets assigned to the task, but it will not delete
  the keyword from assets that were previously added to the task.

Assets
------

You can attach locally stored assets or existing assets from your DAM to
the task. If a request form includes the **Attachment** field, a
requester may may have already assigned assets.

Any assets attached to a task from locations other than your DAM will
automatically be uploaded to a folder in the DAM called **Workstream
Assets**. (Read more about `the Workstream Assets
folder </dam/workstream/getting-started>`__.)

There are several methods you can use to attach assets to tasks,
including the following:

#. On the **Task details** page, drag and drop assets into the
   **Assets** section.
#. On the **Task details** page, point to the **Assets** section and
   click the ``(+)`` **Plus** icon.

   -  Click **Add from |acquia-product:dam|** to select assets currently
      in the DAM.
   -  Click **Add from Computer** to select new assets from your
      computer.

#. To remove an asset, point to the asset and click the ``(X)`` icon in
   the top-right corner. This will remove the asset from the task, but
   it won’t delete the asset from the **Workstream Assets** folder.

   |Remove an item|

.. _submitted:

Submitted Information
---------------------

You can review and update the information filled out in the request form
