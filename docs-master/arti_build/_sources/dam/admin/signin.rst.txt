Signing in as another user
==========================

The option to log in as a teammate gives admins the ability to view
|acquia-product:dam| as another user for troubleshooting and/or training
purposes.

For example, before rolling out the DAM to all users, an admin might
want to view |acquia-product:bc| as a user to ensure that everything
(including permissions) is set up properly.

Once logged in as a teammate, you will view |acquia-product:dam| from
that user’s perspective and be able to perform all actions based on that
user’s group permissions. Any action that you perform will display in
the corresponding report. For example, logging in as a teammate will
display in the **Login Tracker** report, while any downloads will
display in the **Download Tracker** report.
