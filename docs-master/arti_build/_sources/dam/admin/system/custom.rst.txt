Creating custom fields and forms
================================

.. container:: message-status

  This feature is available only to |acquia-product:dam| Professional
  subscribers.

Admins can create custom fields for the registration and download
request forms, allowing you to gather important information from users
during the registration process â€” such as their department, title, or
how they will be using the asset.

.. _create:

Create a custom field
---------------------

#. Sign in to |acquia-product:dam|.
#. Click the settings icon |Settings|, and then click **System
   Preferences**.
#. Click **Custom Fields** in the left-hand navigation.
#. Click the ``(+)`` in the actions toolbar.

   |Adding a custom field|

#. Select the **Field Type** from the drop down menu.
#. If you choose **Picklist**, enter the picklist values in the Options
   section. You can also set the default value that displays to your
   users.
#. You can also alphabetize your picklist, by selecting the box next to
   **Sort Alphabetically**. Any time you add a new value, you'll need to
   sort the list again to alphabetize it. If desired, after sorting you
   can reorder values to keep more common inputs at the top of your
   list.

   |Picklist sorted|

   the name is only seen by the admin.
#. Click **Save**.

Helpful information
-------------------

-  You can create registration rules based on responses to custom fields
   to automatically add users to certain groups and/or automatically
   have them approved. (Read more about `registration
   rules </dam/admin/system/users>`__.)
-  Some fields of the registration and download request form cannot be
   edited, removed or rearranged.
-  The same custom field can be added to both the registration and
   download request forms.
