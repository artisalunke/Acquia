Sharing assets
==============

If you want to share assets with other individuals or users, you can
`email an asset link <#link>`__ to another |acquia-product:dam| user,
`email a link to a download <#download>`__ that is accessible by anyone,
or send assets by using `Box </dam/integrate/box>`__ or
`Dropbox </dam/integrate/dropbox>`__.

Emailing a download

Users with download permissions can email a download of that asset to
other users. The recipient does not need to be a |acquia-product:dam|
user; however, the recipient will be able to only download the asset for
a configurable amount of time.

#. `Sign in to |acquia-product:dam| </dam/access>`__, and then select
   one or more assets that you want to share.
#. In the actions toolbar of the asset details page, click the **Share**
   icon |Share|, and then click **Email download**.

   |Sharing email download bar|

#. Enter the email address of the recipient. If you are sending to
   multiple recipients, separate the emails with a comma.
#. Enter a subject and message (optional), set the download expiration
   (how long the user has to download the asset), and designate the
   download size.
#. Click **Send**.
