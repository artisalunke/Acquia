Changing an asset's status
==========================

You can change the status of assets depending on who you want them
available to. Active assets and folders are visible to all users with
appropriate permissions. Inactive assets and folders are only visible to
admins and contributors with appropriate permissions and only admins can
download inactive assets. The statuses also work in conjunction with
publish status. (`Read more about publishing folders and
assets </dam/brand-connect/publish>`__.)

.. _set:

Set an asset or folder status
-----------------------------

The status of an asset will display in the asset and folder details
panel. A green |Active Asset| icon indicates that the asset is active,
while a red |Inactive Asset| icon indicates that it is inactive. Admins
and contributors with edit asset permission to a folder may edit the
status of assets.

#. Sign into |acquia-product:dam| and select the asset(s) or folder(s)
   you'd like to set the status for.
#. Click the |Pencil| **Pencil** icon on the actions toolbar and select
   **Activate** or **Deactivate**. You can also click the green |Active
   Asset| or red |Inactive Asset| icon to update the status.

.. _default:

Set the default status
----------------------

You can configure the default status of assets upon upload and folders
when they are created. In most cases, the status of assets and folders
will be active.

#. Sign into |acquia-product:dam|.
#. Click the |Settings| **Settings** icon and select **System
   Preferences**.
#. Configure the settings:

   -  In the **Assets** section: **Default status of assets on upload**
      â€“ set the status of newly uploaded assets to **Active** or
      **Inactive**.
   -  In the **Folders** section: **Default status of folders on
      create** - Set whether you want the status of newly created
      folders to be **Active** or **Inactive**.

#. Click **Save**.

Additional Information
----------------------

In other sections of |acquia-product:dam|, a green |Active Asset| icon
indicates that the user or rule is active and in working order, while a
red |Inactive Asset| icon indicates that the user or rule is inactive
and therefore not in use. Learn more about statuses for
`users </dam/admin/users>`__, `registration
rules </dam/admin/system/users>`__ and `download
rules </dam/admin/system/download>`__.
