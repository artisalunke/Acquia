Modifying images and videos
===========================

The |acquia-product:dam| crop tool makes it easy to crop and resize
images – and works in tandem with the conversion options to change file
type, resolution and color space – without moving the image from
|acquia-product:dam|.

Additionally, you can also create video clips. Choose any video and
create a snippet or clip of the section you want.
