Linking assets to other assets
==============================

The **Related Assets** tool enables admins and contributors to link
assets together – meaning that if you’re viewing an asset, previews of
its related assets will appear in the right panel. (Those previews will
not appear if the user doesn’t have permissions for the asset.)

|Related Assets window|

To relate one asset to many assets:

#. Sign in to the core application.
#. Select the asset you would like to relate to others.
#. From the right navigation panel, click **Add Related**.
   |Related Assets button|
#. The **Asset Chooser** allows you to navigate to any folder in your
   |acquia-product:dam| account and view the assets within. Simply click
   the assets you want to relate to your previously selected asset.
#. Click **Save** when finished.

To relate multiple assets to each other:

#. From the **Thumbnail View**, hold down the ``Control`` (PC) or
   ``Command`` (Mac) key and select the assets that will relate to each
   other. (To select a range of assets, select the first asset in the
   set, hold down ``SHIFT`` and select the last asset in the set.)
#. Click the |Pencil| **Edit** icon on the actions toolbar.
#. Choose **Relate X Assets**.
