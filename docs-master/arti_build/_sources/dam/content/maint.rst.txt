Asset maintenance best practices
================================

Now that you are up and running with |acquia-product:dam|, it is
important to take some time to consider how to maintain your assets so
that it continues to be a dependable resource for your users.

Here are some important tips on maintaining your assets in
|acquia-product:dam|:

-  Educate your contributors on your metadata strategy. When you make
   changes to your metadata strategy, communicate those changes to your
   contributors as well.
-  Don’t plan to add metadata later. Add metadata right after you upload
   assets to |acquia-product:dam|.
-  Keep keywords consistent by using a controlled vocabulary. When
   building the controlled vocabulary, gather feedback from contributors
   and general users to ensure that the words on the list are
   meaningful. Update the controlled vocabulary regularly.
-  Audit your assets for metadata completeness and organization
   regularly. Are assets being keyworded, and are they being placed in
   the correct folders?
-  Hold your contributors accountable for their role in
   |acquia-product:dam|, for tasks such as adding metadata.
-  Request feedback from users and take action on that feedback. If
   users are not able to locate a given set of assets, perhaps it is
   because they are searching by keywords that you are not tagging
   assets with.
-  Set up metadata dropdown menus for commonly used fields such as
   photographer name or brand.
-  Keep your folder structure current. If you have folders setup
   product, when a new product is added to your organization’s
   portfolio, add a folder for the new product right away.
-  Check for misspellings and typos in metadata and keywords. One
   misspelling can keep an asset from being found.
-  Set a schedule for your audits and stick to it.

Following these guidelines can save you time and effort in the future.
