Your brand is your most valuable asset, but itâ€™s also your most fragile
due to its growing number of environments and people with a hand in both
shaping and sharing it.

|acquia-product:dam| |acquia-product:bc| is an add-on feature that
extends the core |acquia-product:dam| functionality to centralize
approved content with adaptable brand guidelines and distribution
controls. Doing this can help to ensure that your brand stays on
strategy, regardless of where it goes and who works on it.
