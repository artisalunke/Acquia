  This feature is included with |acquia-product:dam| Professional.

|acquia-product:dam| Workstream is an add-on feature that aligns people,
tasks, and approvals, allowing your creative team to produce great
results without wasted effort.

Workstream is designed to enhance the creative workflow, meaning that it
focuses on assets, adapts to the way your team works, automates approval
paths, and makes reviews and markups simple for both designers and
non-designers.

Using Workstream with your team provides the following benefits:

-  *Adaptable processes* – Build creative project management processes
   by adding the steps that you need to get work done quickly, and
   removing the steps that slow you down.
-  *System of record* – Document every part of a project from initiation
   to reviews through completion, allowing you to review projects and
   optimize your processes.
-  *Collaboration tools* – Maintain focus on the task at hand by
   centering conversations around each project and assignment.
-  *Mobile access* – Work doesn’t stop just because you’re away from the
   office. Check proofs, provide feedback, send approvals, and get
   alerts wherever you go.
-  *Automated approvals* – Streamline and expedite the creative workflow
   review process with multi-tiered approval routing, which helps you
   keep projects moving toward completion.
-  *Precision proofing* – Mark up any file type—even video—to provide
   clear, actionable feedback that removes confusion from the project
   management review process.
-  *Real-time notifications* – With real-time creative workflow alerts
   and notifications, you can identify obstacles early and avoid the
   last-minute changes that cause teams to miss deadlines.
-  *Configurable creative briefs* – Use the Workstream drag-and-drop
   builder to configure creative briefs that gather requirements
   specific to the task at hand.
