<h2>Creating a Support or TAM ticket<a class="headerlink" href="#creating-a-support-or-tam-ticket" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>To create a ticket, you must have an Acquia subscription that allows it

For more information, see the <a class="reference external" href="/support/guide">Support Users Guide</a>.</p>
<p>On the ticket creation screen, select whether you want to create a

and then click <strong>Create</strong>.</p>
<p>You can also create a ticket by signing in to the Acquia Cloud interface,

<div class="section" id="entering-ticket-field-information">
<h2>Entering Ticket field information<a class="headerlink" href="#entering-ticket-field-information" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>The following information will help you determine what to enter in the
ticket creation fields so that Acquia Support can best help you in a
timely manner.</p>
<div class="section" id="support-tickets-urgency">
<h3>Support tickets: urgency<a class="headerlink" href="#support-tickets-urgency" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Support tickets have an urgency level. This value determines how quickly
Acquia Support will respond to the request and does not impact a
ticket’s time-to-resolution. Here’s what the different urgency levels
mean:</p>
<table border="1" class="colwidths-given docutils">
<colgroup>
<col width="15%" />
<col width="85%" />
</colgroup>
<thead valign="bottom">
<tr class="row-odd"><th class="head">Urgency</th>
<th class="head">Description</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody valign="top">
<tr class="row-even"><td><em>Critical</em></td>
<td>Your production system is inoperative, your business operations or productivity are severely impacted with no available workaround, or there is a critical security issue. Critical issues are eligible for 24x7 support for certain Acquia subscriptions.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="row-odd"><td><em>High</em></td>
<td>Your production system is operating, but the issue is causing significant disruption of your business operations; a workaround is inadequate.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="row-even"><td><em>Medium</em></td>
<td>Your system is operating and the issue’s impact on your business operations is moderate to low; a workaround or alternative is available.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="row-odd"><td><em>Low</em></td>
<td>The issue is a minor inconvenience and does not impact business operations in any significant way; issues with little or no time sensitivity.</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>Whenever possible, customers are advised to file support tickets as
<strong>Medium</strong> urgency, reserving the use of <strong>High</strong> for exceptional,
non-urgent circumstances that require a more immediate response. <strong>Low</strong>
urgency should be utilized for issues which can be addressed within the
next business day, as this allows Acquia Support to more quickly respond
to other issues which are more time-sensitive. For more information, see
<a class="reference external" href="https://www.acquia.com/drupal-support/issue-urgency-definitions">Issue Urgency Definitions</a>.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="subject">
<h3>Subject<a class="headerlink" href="#subject" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Acquia recommends that ticket titles be short and to the point, summing
up the nature of the issue and which websites or environments are
affected. This also allows Acquia to quickly identify and respond to
trends if multiple customers are experiencing the same issue. As you
enter text in the field, related links may appear underneath the subject
field to assist you with solving common problems. Links will open in a
new tab.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="issue-description">
<h3>Issue description<a class="headerlink" href="#issue-description" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Provide as complete a description of the issue as you can. A good,
clear, complete description can help Acquia respond to your issue faster
and more accurately, with a first response that is more likely to be a
useful solution, rather than just a request for additional information.
Acquia’s ticketing system supports
<a class="reference external" href="/support/tickets/markdown">Markdown</a>. Keep the following tips in
mind when you provide your issue description:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><strong>Provide the full URLs affected by the issue</strong>
This includes URLs of pages on your website where you see errors
listed, Acquia UI URLs, or URLs of third-party services having
trouble connecting to your Acquia website. We can trace these full
URLs to exactly what code is running and creating the behavior you
are seeing. These URLs help determine whether you are having issues
on Acquia servers, your Acquia Cloud servers, or your own web
servers outside of Acquia Cloud. This also shows us, at a
glance, when you are talking about a local instance of a website or a
public production website. This is an important part of orienting us
in these cases.</li>
<li><strong>Describe the context and nature of the problem</strong>
<em>I see white screens on every page</em> is more descriptive than <em>My site
is down!</em></li>
<li><strong>Include the ticket numbers of related tickets, when possible</strong>
This enables the Acquia Support team to quickly research related
changes.</li>
<li><strong>Include the exact text of any error and where it’s being
displayed</strong></li>
<li><strong>Where applicable, include the Task ID for any failed tasks</strong>
If your issue involves a failed task while using the
Acquia Cloud interface or a command line operation, we can use the Task
ID to help us identify the type and source of the error and
immediately access the corresponding lines in the logs.</li>
<li><strong>Tell us when the issue occurred (exact time and time zone)</strong>
This allows us to more accurately correlate the issue with any errors
or abnormalities in your logs. If you are not sure, try to confirm
the last time it worked correctly, if ever.</li>
<li><strong>If relevant, attach screenshots or logs</strong>
Include the browser’s URL bar in any screenshots. Tell us the full
path of the log file.</li>
<li><strong>List the steps that will reproduce the issue</strong>
Do we need any special access or permissions, or do we need to take
any atypical actions, to reproduce this issue?</li>
<li><strong>Tell us what you have done to try to resolve the issue yourself</strong>
Did it change the symptoms you experienced at all? If you explain
what did not work, you might keep us from trying something you have
already tried. That could get us on a fruitful path more quickly.</li>
<li><strong>Describe anything that was confusing about what happened</strong>
This information can help us figure out what parts of our platform
may be confusing you. This can suggest future improvements to user
experience or documentation that may help straighten out the issue
you are having and help other users as well.</li>
<li><strong>Are there any special instructions or warnings we should keep in
mind when attempting to troubleshoot this issue?</strong></li>

respond to the ticket and provide assistance as soon as possible, based
on the ticket’s urgency and subscription level.</p>
<p>In many instances, Acquia will request additional information or provide
technical recommendations in their response. When this happens, it is
important to provide a timely response and ensure that a technical
resource is available (if the issue requires it) to answer questions or
assist in implementing application-related fixes.</p>
<div class="section" id="finding-a-ticket">

the tickets.</p>
<p>If you only have a six-digit ticket number (for example #123456), you
can find it using the following URL pattern:

<p>Replying to a <strong>Solved</strong> ticket changes its status to <strong>In Progress</strong>
until a further solution is reached, at which time the ticket will again
be marked as <strong>Solved</strong>. After the ticket has been marked as <strong>Solved</strong>
for 14 days, it will be permanently set to <strong>Closed</strong>. If you need to

<h2>Issues with autoresponders<a class="headerlink" href="#issues-with-autoresponders" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Users subscribed to Acquia cannot have any type of autoresponder
functionality enabled. Autoresponders have the potential to create
endless <em>communication loops</em> (in which two or more systems repeatedly
send automated emails to one another) which can affect our ability to
respond in a timely manner regarding your issue. Since many types of
systems can use autoresponders, this functionality includes, but is not
limited to, the following:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>group aliases</li>
<li>mailing lists</li>
<li>ticketing systems</li>
</ul>
<p>Acquia reserves the right to suspend any user account that is causing
communication loops.</p>

<h2>Problems with conflicting ticketing systems<a class="headerlink" href="#problems-with-conflicting-ticketing-systems" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>If you have your own ticketing system that is capable of creating
tickets by email and you add your ticketing system’s email address as a
contact for your subscription, Acquia’s ticketing system may then create
reciprocal tickets in your system. This can create a communication loop
in which both systems repeatedly send automated emails to one another.
Situations like this can interfere with Acquia’s ticketing workflow, and
may result in responses to tickets being lost or missed. You can prevent
this from happening by performing either of the following actions:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><a class="reference external" href="/acquia-cloud/teams/members">Remove your ticketing system’s contact email</a> from your subscription</li>
<li><dl class="first docutils">
<dt><a class="reference external" href="/acquia-cloud/teams/roles">Edit your ticketing system’s contact permissions</a> and remove the</dt>

</ul>
</div>
<div class="section" id="new-subscriptions">
<h2>New subscriptions<a class="headerlink" href="#new-subscriptions" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>

subscription with the same contacts as the ones you’d like to have on
your new subscription. This will allow us to make sure the appropriate

<p>Ensure that you identify any issue that could prevent Acquia from
accessing your website for troubleshooting purposes.</p>
<p>For example, the Drupal account created during installation (UID 1) has
all permissions by default, so failing to secure this account may result
in potential security risks. To protect against this, you may block UID
1 from accessing your website, but doing so could prevent Acquia from
accessing your website to troubleshoot issues.</p>
<p>There are two methods that you can use to avoid this problem, without
creating a security risk:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Remove the block to UID 1 and use other restriction methods instead.
For more information, see <a class="reference external" href="/articles/website-access-restriction-methods">Website access restriction
methods</a>.</li>
<li>Share a persistent username and password that Acquia can use to
access your website. Do not share this username and password in a
ticket; instead, add the credentials to a file in the
<code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">/home/sitename</span></code> directory.</li>
</ul>

<div class="section" id="satisfaction-survey">
<h2>Satisfaction survey<a class="headerlink" href="#satisfaction-survey" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>After closing a ticket, you may be offered a brief satisfaction survey
which allows you to rate your experience as <strong>Good</strong> or <strong>Bad</strong>. The
survey also includes an opportunity for you to provide a comment
regarding the ticket.</p>
