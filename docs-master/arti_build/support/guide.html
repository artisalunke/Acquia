<p>Support coverage outside normal business hours is limited to the
mitigation of Critical issues as outlined previously in the <a class="reference external" href="#problem">Problem
definition categories</a> section. Customers are highly
encouraged to launch during normal business hours when technical teams
are fully staffed and the scope of coverage goes beyond limited Critical
issue mitigation.</p>
<p>Acquia treats issues that prevent a website from launching as critical
and eligible for 24x7 support if all of the following conditions apply:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>The deployed website code and configuration have passed functional
and load tests by the customerâs project team. (Site development is
complete.)</li>
<li>The Customer Risk Report (CRR) provided by Acquia Ready includes no
critical (red) items.</li>
<li>Launch is less than three calendar days away.</li>
<li>Launch date has been registered and confirmed with either Acquia
Support or Acquia Ready at least seven days prior to expected launch.</li>
<li>Customer subscription level provides for 24x7 critical support.</li>

<span id="critical-requests"></span><h3>Submitting critical support requests<a class="headerlink" href="#submitting-critical-support-requests" title="Permalink to this headline">Â¶</a></h3>
<p>For issues that meet the criteria of a Critical, Customers may report
the issues using an online ticket (preferred method) or by telephone.
24x7x365 support is available only to Customers with or Starter, Basic,
Business, Premium, and Elite Subscriptions, or legacy Pro Plus,
Enterprise or Elite Support subscriptions. Refer to your current order
form or contact your Account Manager if you are unsure.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><em>Online Ticket</em> - Tickets designated with Critical urgency initiate
internal alerts and designate the request for a priority response.</li>
<li><em>Phone</em> - When filing a Critical request by phone, press <strong>6</strong> from
the main menu. This is a silent option not listed in the voice
prompt. You will be directed to the Critical support voicemail. Leave
a message with the name and phone number of the technical contact to
be contacted, Website name, and a description of the issue. Be sure
to include a clear description of the symptoms and any actions taken
that may be related to the cause or attempted remedies.</li>
</ul>
<p>Acquiaâs on-call support team member will take the following actions:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><em>Initial action</em> - Contact the Customer reporting the issue or as
otherwise designated.</li>
<li><em>Before changes are made</em> - Request confirmation in a ticket for
changes to the website or configuration that were requested verbally.</li>
<li><em>Ongoing action</em> - Issue regular Customer and internal updates until
resolution.</li>

<div class="admonition note">
<p class="first admonition-title">Note</p>
<p class="last">Automated ticket submissions generated by internal or external infrastructure or website monitoring applications are not permitted. Acquia no longer accepts new support requests through acquia.com email addresses and only supports updates to tickets submitted online through this channel.

<p>Support for all non-Critical issues is available during Acquia business
hours. You can submit these tickets either by online ticket or a phone
call:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><em>Online Ticket</em> - Customer will make requests of Acquia support
through Acquiaâs online ticket management system.</li>
<li><em>Phone</em> - Monday â Friday (determined by Customerâs address).
Developer and Partner subscriptions are not entitled to phone
support.</li>
<li><em>Email</em> - Acquia no longer accepts new support requests by email and
requests that all customers submit new support requests either online
or by phone. This allows us to associate important subscription and
priority information with the request so that our teams can
expediently handle the request. Acquia may still handle replies and
updates to support tickets submitted online by email provided that
the email body is retained in the reply.</li>
</ul>
<p>Issue submission process:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>When submitting a ticket, the Customer provides a description of the
issue or request, a description of the mission impact, and designates
the level of urgency of the request as Critical, High, Medium, or Low
pursuant to the urgency categories set forth in the <a class="reference external" href="#problem">Problem
definition categories</a> section.</li>
<li>Acquia evaluates the request and provides an initial response in the
time determined by the Customer subscriptionâs service response
levels.</li>
<li>The Customer works with Acquia to provide additional information
about reported issue (for example, website functionality, related
applications as needed to diagnose the issue, and
infrastructure-related information).</li>
<li>Acquia tracks progress notes and related communications in the online
ticket system through the resolution of the issue or request.</li>
<li>Acquia contacts the Customer either by phone or by using the online
ticket system to confirm details and initiate diagnosis.</li>
<li>If the Customer makes a request by phone, Acquia opens a ticket on
the Customerâs behalf to track the issue through resolution. If
changes to the website or configuration are requested verbally,
confirmation will be requested in a ticket before the changes are
made.</li>
<li>Issues not submitted to Acquia either through the online ticket
portal or by phone bypass our standard request handling and default
to Medium or Low priority. This may cause a delay in the desired
response time.</li>

<p>In order to provide the most consistent, high quality support to our
Customer across the globe, Acquia has set the following standards for
communications with our Customer:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>All written communications will be in English. This ensures that all
Support team members can work on all Critical issues, and experts can
be engaged in a Customer situation without delay.</li>
<li>Acquia Support can participate in English language discussions with
Customers across all geographies 24/7.</li>
<li>Spanish language conversations are available in the Americas during
business hours (8am-8pm Eastern) pending resource availability.</li>
<li>Acquia Support may be available to converse with Customers in the
following languages during Europeâs business hours (8a-6p CET),
pending resource availability:<ul>
<li>French</li>

this area so that we may be in the best position to support our

<p>Acquia reserves the right to retire support for certain versions of the
supported applications. As a standard, Acquia will support the current
major version of Drupal (N) and the immediately preceding major version
(N-1). For example, Acquia will support Drupal 8.x and Drupal 7.x
simultaneously. This ensures that Customers receive the best possible
support and are able to take advantage of the latest features and
security enhancements in the software.</p>
<p>Acquia will provide full support to earlier versions (N-2) until the
Drupal Community chooses to stop providing security fixes for version
N-2. To ensure that our Customers experience smooth migrations to newer
versions of Drupal, Acquia may provide Transition Support for version
N-2 for a period of no less than 12 months. Prior to retiring support
for any Drupal version, Acquia will provide at minimum of 12 months
notice to our Customers. Notice will be provided in one or more of the
following ways: on the Acquia Cloud interface, through documentation, or
through Customer notice (email) to registered users of
Acquia Cloud. After a version is retired, Support will be limited
to preexisting documentation.</p>
<p>As we continue to implement new products and services and upgrade
technologies on the Acquia Cloud platform, we will implement
end-of-life (EOL) deadlines that may require action on your part. For
specific information on software versions and upgrade plans, see the

<p>Acquia Support will assist with diagnosis and repair of âdecoupledâ
Drupal applications and the Acquia environment in which they run. There
are two ways you can decouple Drupal: first, progressive decoupling. It
consists of interpolating a JavaScript framework into the Drupal front
end without leveraging server-side rendering via Node.js. Second, fully
decoupled Drupal, which involves a complete separation of concerns
between the structure of your content and its presentation, thus
allowing front-end developers to have more control and freedom, but also
results in a loss of some out-of-the-box CMS (Content Management System)
functionality such as in-place editing or content preview.</p>
<p>Troubleshooting non-Drupal front-end applications, whether hosted on the
Acquia Cloud environment or not, is currently out of scope if not
explicitly covered under an Acquia Support contract. Customers are
responsible for the proper functioning, performance, diagnosis and
repair of non-Drupal front-end applications in a decoupled
configuration.</p>
<p>The following diagram shows areas of responsibility for a Node.js
application:</p>

<p>Acquia strongly encourages customers to perform <a class="reference external" href="/acquia-cloud/performance/load">load
tests</a> in a clone of the production
environment in advance of any major code release. Certain performance
impacting issues can be only be found through proper load testing and it
is the best way to reduce launch risk. For more information about
readying your website for a significant future event, see <a class="reference external" href="/support/traffic">Preparing for
a high-traffic event</a>.</p>
<p>Acquia Support can provide best practice advice on the process of load
testing, and best practice advice on how to resolve specific findings
from load testing. Acquia Support does not design, conduct, or monitor a
load test, nor does Support interpret or analyze the results of load
tests; however, all of these services are available from Acquia as
separate engagements. Contact your Account Manager for details.</p>
<p>For valid results, load tests must be conducted on a clone of your
websiteâs production environment, or in the current production
environment if the website is not yet launched. Acquia provides access
to dedicated load balancers specifically for load testing purposes by
prior arrangement. Customers cannot use shared hardware for load testing
as this will negatively impact production websites for other customers.

<p>Acquia provides full infrastructure support to any Customer running its
applications on Acquia Cloud, Acquia Cloud Enterprise, or
Acquia Cloud Site Factory platforms. Because Acquiaâs platform configuration
files contain Acquiaâs intellectual property and are very specific to
our infrastructure, these files cannot be shared with Customers or
partners.</p>
<p>Development and staging environments are designed and intended only for
development and testing. Running production websites on development or
staging environments is not supported, because they are not sized for
production traffic and loads. In addition, development and staging
environments may include shared resources which, if impacted by
production-level traffic, may be in violation of terms of service.
Acquia offers High-Availability and multi-region failover environments
for customers with such requirements.</p>
<p>If a Customer chooses to host their application internally or with a
third-party provider, Acquia Support is unable to provide
troubleshooting or support assistance with the infrastructure. This
limitation includes reviewing the Customerâs hardware, settings, and
non-supported software infrastructure. Acquia Professional Services is

balancers may provide a <a class="reference external" href="/acquia-cloud/performance/custom-varnish">customized, tested VCL
configuration</a> for Acquia
to implement on the Customerâs dedicated load balancers.</p>
<p>Acquia does not test customized VCL configurations. It is the Customerâs
responsibility to test VCL changes in advance of supplying the
configuration to Acquia. Prior to implementing the modifications on the
Customerâs live balancer, Acquia will implement the VCL configuration
changes on a load-testing balancer. It is the Customerâs responsibility
to test these changes, confirm they are working as expected, and grant
Acquia written permission to implement the changes on the live balancer.
Acquia deploys custom VCL files on a set schedule so turnaround time to
implement a custom VCL may be up to one week. Acquia may reject a
modified VCL file if the modifications prove disruptive to the Platform

<li>One or multiple Solr configuration files attached to the ticket.</li>
<li>Files must be UTF-8-encoded without a Byte Order Mark (BOM), with
LF (Unix-style) line endings.</li>
<li>Can request changes to multiple Solr indexes, as long as all files

<li>Customers are responsible for pre-testing configuration changes
before submitting them to Acquia. Customizations that do not pass

platforms may choose to use hardware that is shared with other
customers. Sustained usage of any shared resource (such as, but not

<p>If a website has issues with application stability and performance due
to application issues which cannot be remedied by Acquiaâs intervention,

<span id="slow-queries"></span><h3>Long-running queries<a class="headerlink" href="#long-running-queries" title="Permalink to this headline">Â¶</a></h3>
<p>Database queries can be both generated by Drupal in response to website
visitors displaying pages on which selective data is displayed, and
through administrative or maintenance actions taken by a website
developer or administrator.</p>
<p>Any query with a running time of greater than one second is a
long-running query. A single particularly long-running query or a high
volume of shorter long-running queries may negatively impact overall
website performance, and can result in an interruption of a websiteâs
availability. For recommendations about how to resolve slow queries, see
the <a class="reference external" href="/articles/how-fix-slow-queries">How to fix slow queries</a> Acquia
Help Center article.</p>
<p>Terminating a task that contains a long-running query can result in data
loss or a <em>split-brain</em> condition between databases in a High
Availability environment. Due to these potential consequences, Acquia
Support will not proactively terminate long-running queries without
customer authorization.</p>
<p>In the event a long-running query is impairing website performance,
Acquia Support will attempt to contact the customer to obtain permission
to terminate the query. Acquia Support will not terminate a query
without confirmation from the customer and an acknowledgement of the
potential consequences.</p>
<p>If Acquia Support cannot obtain confirmation from the customer, the

<li>Migration best practices</li>
<li>Performance best practices</li>
<li>Architecture best practices</li>
<li>Module development best practices</li>
</ul>
<p>Advisory hours may be consumed in blocks of time not to exceed two (2)
hours unless there is prior approval from Acquia Support Management.
Time is applied against Advisory hours in the following manner:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><em>Time spent</em> - For example, for each hour of discussion between
Acquia and the Customer, one hour is consumed.</li>
<li><em>Preparation time</em> - For each Advisory session greater than one hour,
Acquia may charge the Customer an additional 30 minutes of
preparation time.</li>
<li><em>Follow-up</em> - Acquia reserves the right to charge the Customer for
time spent if session follow-up requires 30 minutes or more of the
Advisory expertâs time.</li>
</ul>
<p>Customers must make requests for Advisory sessions at least three
business days in advance of the desired meeting team. Acquia will make
all efforts to schedule Advisory Calls based on the Customerâs requested
timing, but reserves the right to schedule at a mutually agreed
alternative date if necessary.</p>

<p>Acquia monitors traffic and capacity for Acquia Cloud Enterprise
subscriptions. If Acquia detects that your website has gone down or is
in imminent danger of going down for any reason (such as a significant
increase in web traffic or poor performing code), Acquia will add
additional server capacity to your website. We will contact you about
upsizing your website, but will not wait for your prior approval. You
will be responsible for any additional costs for the additional
hardware, and any upsizing will remain in effect for a minimum of one
week.</p>
<p>Acquia Cloud Enterprise customers with qualified subscriptions can use
<a class="reference external" href="/acquia-cloud/csm">Cloud Service Management</a>, a self-service scaling
feature that allows web capacity to be managed at any time.</p>
<p>Acquia does not manage server capacity for Acquia Cloud Professional
subscriptions. Acquia Cloud Professional is a self-service platform, and
customers are responsible for monitoring their server capacity and
resizing as needed. For more information, see <a class="reference external" href="/acquia-cloud/manage/servers">Managing your
servers</a>.</p>

<p>Acquia recognizes that, on occasion, Customers may encounter critical
problems that require a higher level of communication and interaction.
We have established an effective process to support these special
situations.</p>
<p>If at any time you are not satisfied with the current plan of action for
an active issue, you may request that it be escalated to management
directly through your Acquia Support point of contact. You may also
request to review the matter with an Acquia Support manager.</p>
<p>The following actions take place when you escalate an issue:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>The Acquia Support Leadership team is notified of the situation, and
when appropriate, the Customerâs Account Manager is notified as well.</li>
<li>A review of your business needs and technical case is conducted and
an action plan is formulated with the goal of driving your issue to
the most rapid resolution possible.</li>
<li>Communication of the action plan is discussed with the Customer,
including deliverables and, if appropriate, timelines.</li>
<li>If the communication is not acceptable, the Customer may request to
speak with the next level of management:<ul>
<li>First Level - Regional Manager</li>
<li>Second Level - Director, Acquia Support</li>
<li>Third Level - Managing Director, Global Support</li>
<li>Fourth Level - VP Customer Solutions</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<p>All cases that are submitted as âCriticalâ copy the Acquia Support
Leadership team. This helps ensure that these situations receive
management attention immediately.</p>

<ul class="simple">
<li><em>Conference Bridge Participation</em> - Acquia understands that some of
our Customers have a policy to open a conference bridge when an issue
is defined and remain on that bridge until the problem is solved or
the severity lessens. We have found that the bridge format is not
conducive to orderly troubleshooting and often delays the resolution
of critical issues. In order to provide all of our Customers with the
highest quality of support possible, it is our policy to not
participate in these bridge calls until a complete problem
description has been provided. This may be done online or through a
phone call. After Acquia receives this information, it will select
the appropriate resource to join the call. Acquia management reserves
the right to not assign resources to participate in bridge calls that
are outside the scope of Acquia support.</li>
<li><em>Customer chat channels</em> - Acquia Support will not establish or join
customer chat channels.</li>
<li><em>Conference Calls</em> - There are times when direct communication over a
conference call or similar meeting is the best means of addressing a
specific issue or clarifying recommendations that have been provided.
Conference calls can be requested and scheduled by a request to a
Customer Advisor or Support Leadership.</li>
<li><em>Access to Customer Systems</em> - For the purposes of providing
diagnostic support, Acquia Support may request read-only access to a
Customerâs environment. In limited situations, Acquia Support may
make changes directly to a Customerâs systems; however, action will
not be taken until the Customer confirms by using the active support
system that they understand the change to be made and authorize
Acquia to make the change.</li>

<span id="customer-success"></span><h3>Customer success tips<a class="headerlink" href="#customer-success-tips" title="Permalink to this headline">Â¶</a></h3>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Maintain two or more team members (staff or contractors) that are
familiar with all Customer-controlled code and infrastructure. This
will assist Acquia Support with troubleshooting actions and
facilitate the implementation of recommended solutions.</li>
<li>Ensure that subscription contacts are current.</li>
<li>Use the escalation process and contact channels previously described
because they are the fastest way to drive action without any delay.</li>
<li>Ensure that multiple resources are registered to submit issues under
your Acquia subscription.</li>
<li>Always respond to support tickets using the email address thatâs
registered with Acquia.</li>
<li>Ensure that Customer resources are available to participate in the
issue resolution process and are accessible for the duration of time
that the incident remains open.</li>
<li>Ensure that all Customer designated resources understand the scope
and conditions of Acquiaâs support prior to contacting Acquia.</li>
<li>Do one or both of the following prior to conducting a conference call
with Acquia Support: define the questions/issues to be discussed, or
complete as many outstanding action items as possible.</li>
<li>Check the Acquia Customer Portal often to stay up-to-date on training
and the latest product updates and announcements.</li>
<li>If at any time you do not understand a request being made by Acquia
Support, be sure to ask for a clarification or explanation.</li>
<li>Notify Acquia Support, Technical Account Manager, or the Onboarding
team of any impending launches or significant website events. If
possible, Acquia prefers a two-to-three day lead time. This allows
Acquia to ensure that teams are notified and prepared for the event
to provide critical support as needed.</li>

<p>Acquiaâs remote site administration (RA) service provides for Acquia to

maintenance tasks and minor website modifications that would typically
be handled by an on-site administrator for a fully designed and
operating website. This includes proactive, timely security updates for
Drupal core and contributed modules. Modified core or contributed
modules are supported at Acquiaâs discretion, and run the risk of being
overwritten by Acquia automation unless properly configured by the
