To help you develop and publish your website, the |acquia-product:ld|
`distribution <%5Bacquia-product:kb%5Darticles/distribution-definition>`__
uses a collection of included modules. These modules, provided by Acquia
and the Drupal community (and by Drupal itself), provide a base level of
integrated features that you can use as you develop your website.

.. note::

  If the |acquia-product:ld| distribution doesn't contain a module that you require, simply find and download the module from `Drupal.org <https://www.drupal.org>`__ and then install it on your website. For information about how to install a module, see `Installing modules and themes <https://www.drupal.org/documentation/install/modules-themes>`__ on Drupal.org.

Drupal core modules
-------------------

Regardless of the version of Drupal that it's based on,
|acquia-product:ld| installs a group of Drupal core modules, most of
which can be uninstalled if desired. These modules provide the base
level of functionality for your website, including the areas of content
creation, display, and website administration.
