   Build and deploy a decoupled application using Drupal and Node.js on |acquia-product:ac|.

Tutorial Overview
-----------------

In this tutorial you'll learn how to build a Decoupled Drupal
application with Node.js on |acquia-product:ac|. We'll guide you through the
development and deployment of a Decoupled Architecture hands-on and
step-by-step.

An API-first or Decoupled Drupal application can offer many benefits to
a broader development base than a traditional CMS structure. You need to
understand the core concepts of this workflow in order& to form a
cohesive development plan.

We'll achieve this goal by leveraging the provided codebases for both
the Drupal and Node.js applications, which are designed to work
together. These two separate applications will demonstrate a standard
workflow with the inherent relationship created by content offered by
the Drupal API.

The tutorial includes three in-depth lessons:
