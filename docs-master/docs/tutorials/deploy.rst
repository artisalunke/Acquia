   Deploy a Drupal application to a production environment on Drupal 8.

Tutorial Overview
-----------------

In this tutorial, we will take a Drupal application, prepare the
codebase for production, and deploy that codebase to a production
environment on |acquia-product:ac|.

Using best practices for development is important, especially for
enterprise sites that "can't fail". Implementing processes like
automated testing and continuous integration can be difficult, but they
have a tremendous impact on the quality and stability of software. They
are worth the investment.

This tutorial walks you through the deployment process for a Drupal 8
application on |acquia-product:ac|. It includes four lessons:

#. `Preparing for Production </tutorials/deploy/preparing-production>`__
#. `Generating a Deployment
   Artifact </tutorials/deploy/generating-deployment-artifact>`__
#. `Release the Kraken (code) </tutorials/deploy/release-kraken-code>`__
#. `Post Code Deploy </tutorials/deploy/post-code-deploy>`__
