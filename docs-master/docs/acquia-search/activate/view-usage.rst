Through the use of the |acquia-product:ac| interface, you can learn more
about your |acquia-product:as| subscription and its usage.

Viewing your Acquia Search usage
--------------------------------

To view information about your use of |acquia-product:as|, complete the
following steps:

#. Sign in to your Acquia subscription.
#. Select your application, and then click its **Acquia Search** link.
#. In the upper right corner, click **Search Stats**.

   |Search Stats icon|

The table that appears on the Search page displays how much of your
|acquia-product:as| subscription you are using, including the following
attributes:

-  **Document Count** - The number of documents that are in your search
   index
-  **Query Count** - The number of executed searches
-  **Index Size (MB)** - The amount of storage that your search index
   uses, in megabytes

.. note::

   The **Search Core Name** column displays all provisioned indexes,
   whether or not they are in use.

The information displayed in the table includes how your website's
searches, documents, and storage quantities have changed from month to
month, which can assist you in determining how changes in your website
may have affected changes in your |acquia-product:as| resources. If you
have more than one search index, the table combines the statistics for
all of your provisioned search indexes â€” this can help you plan whether
you might need to upgrade or downgrade your |acquia-product:as|
subscription.
