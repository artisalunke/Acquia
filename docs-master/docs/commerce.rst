Features
--------

|acquia-product:acm| provides a connector to your commerce solution, and has the following features out-of-the-box:

-  *Categories and products synchronization* |br| 
   Categories are stored in a hierarchical taxonomy and products are stored as SKU entities for every possible SKU, with nodes for the displayable products. Drupal can be used to build the expected features — such as a navigation menu, product listing pages, products search, and product detail pages. These features can then integrate with your commerce solution for product details that include initial price, final price, and configurable options, such as size or color, cross sell, textual fields, and media galleries.
-  *Cart management* |br| 
   |acquia-product:acm| provides a cart mechanism for products, including an *Add to cart* functionality that can be customized for single products or multiple products on a webpage, as well as a cart summary for your website header, content summary, and support for promotional codes. It also synchronizes with your commerce solution, allowing for persistent carts if your user's shopping experience is interrupted.
-  *Checkout flow* |br| 
   |acquia-product:acm| provides a default checkout workflow for your use that can also be customized to suit the needs of your organization.
-  *User management* |br| 
   The commerce solution can be used as customer repository and even as authentication backend. A local copy of the user is stored in Drupal, which is pushed to the commerce solution after every update.
