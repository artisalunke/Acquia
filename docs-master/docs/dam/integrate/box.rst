Integration: Box
================

The Box integration makes it easy to move files back and forth between
|acquia-product:dam| and Box. You can use it to quickly centralize
assets stored in various personal or professional Box accounts, and to
distribute files to people who do not have access to
|acquia-product:dam|.

This integration is available to *Admin*, *Contributor*, and regular
users with download or upload permissions. You can transfer assets
smaller than 5GB â€” assets greater than 5GB must use FTP.
