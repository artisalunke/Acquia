Integration: LDAP
=================

..  container:: message-status

  This is an add-on feature. Contact your Account Manager to add this
  feature to your subscription.

By integrating with your Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP)
directory, you can enable LDAP-based user accounts to authenticate with
|acquia-product:dam|. The integration should be handled by your
companyâ€™s LDAP admin, who must have an |acquia-product:dam| account with
`admin privileges </dam/admin/users>`__.

.. _configure:

      is enabled to the |acquia-product:dam| production IP addresses
      (``52.70.22.230``, ``52.70.142.178``)
   -  **SSL** check box - Select this check box if SSL LDAP port is in

Verifying your LDAP login
-------------------------

Complete the following steps to verify that LDAP logins are functioning

   LDAP database, and then click **Login**. If the login is successful,
