Lightboxes in |acquia-product:bc|
=================================

You can use lightboxes to add assets from multiple folders to one
central location. This is useful for circumstances like:

-  You can add images and text documents for different products to a
   lightbox so you can email your agency a link to download all the
   items.
-  Youâ€™re choosing which images to use for a new product brochure and
   need feedback from your manager. Once the images are added to the
   lightbox, you can invite your manager to collaborate and comment on
   the selections.
-  You often need to provide referenceable customers, so you create a
   lightbox of customer logos for easy access and sharing.

.. _comment:

Comment or collaborate in a lightbox
------------------------------------

You can invite other users to add comments and modify a lightbox.

To collaborate in a lightbox:

#. In the lightbox view, click the number in the left column next to
   **Collaborators**.
#. Enter the **Email** address(es) and a message (optional).
#. If you want the recipients to be able to modify the lightbox, select
   the check box for **These users can modify**. This gives recipients
   permission to edit lightbox information and add and remove assets.
#. Click **Share**.

If you only want comments for your lightbox or its assets:

-  *Lightbox comment*: Add the comment in the **Add your comment** box
   in the left column of the lightbox view.
-  *Asset comment*: In the lightbox view, click the asset and write your
   comment in the **Type your comment** field in the right column.
   Assets with comments will display a talk bubble icon showing the
   number of comments. These comments will only be visible to
   collaborators added to the lightbox.

By default, users will receive an in-system notification and email when
a collaborator comments or modifies a lightbox because they will be
watching it.
