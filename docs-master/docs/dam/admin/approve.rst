      asset status will automatically change to (or remain) inactive
      when an approval request is initiated.
   -  **Change status upon approval to Active**: When checked, the asset
      status will automatically change to (or remain) active when an
      asset is approved.
   -  **Change status upon rejection to Inactive**: When checked, the
      asset status will automatically change to (or remain) inactive
      when an asset is rejected.
