Metadata best practices
=======================

Metadata is all of the data used to describe an asset.
|acquia-product:dam| supports both IPTC and XMP Metadata Standards
ensuring interoperability with other tools like Adobe Bridge and
Lightroom.

Using metadata will increase the searchability of your assets. Plus,
assets downloaded from |acquia-product:dam| retain their metadata. This
embedded metadata is another layer of protection for your assets if they
leave.

|Metadata strategy|

Keywords are a unique type of metadata, covered separately in the
`Keyword Best Practices article </dam/admin/metadata/keyword>`__. Here
are some recommended best practices to help get you started in your
metadata efforts:

-  Always add ownership or credit information to your assets for
   identification outside of |acquia-product:dam|.
-  Add in usage terms for rights-managed assets to prevent any misuse.
-  Add metadata to your assets as soon as you upload them into
   |acquia-product:dam|.
-  Implement predefined drop-down menus for commonly used data to
   prevent inconsistencies.
-  Educate contributors responsible for adding metadata in
   |acquia-product:dam|, on your organization’s metadata strategy.
-  Communicate to any external vendors your metadata requirements, i.e.
   “Photos must be submitted with the Usage Terms, Credit, and Location
   metadata already added.”
-  Conduct regular audits to ensure metadata is being added properly.

When communicating information on your best practices for metadata and
any processes surrounding it, make sure the end goal is made clear as
well. Adding metadata can be time consuming and tedious. Structured and
consistent metadata is the foundation for building a asset management
system that is highly searchable, easily browsed, and dependable for
archiving.
