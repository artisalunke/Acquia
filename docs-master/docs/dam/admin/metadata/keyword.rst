Keyword best practices
======================

Keywords are a subset of metadata. In |acquia-product:dam|, keywords are
applied to your assets as clickable links. When a user clicks on a given
keyword, |acquia-product:dam| will display results for all assets
containing that same keyword. All metadata fields are searchable, but
only keywords are clickable links.

Implementing a controlled vocabulary provides even more search power and
greatly increases efficiency by adding keywords to your assets. After
you build and upload your controlled vocabulary into
|acquia-product:dam|, be sure to also enable the option to display your
controlled vocabulary on the power search page.

Whether you are implementing a controlled vocabulary or adding keywords
freely, it is important to outline some best practices to guide your
efforts. Acquia recommends the following guidelines for your use:

-  **Be thorough in keywording assets.** Cover the who, the what, the
   when, the where, and the why.
-  **Be consistent with acronyms and abbreviations.** Don’t keyword one
   asset with the abbreviation AZ, and another asset with Arizona.
-  **Be consistent in plurals versus singulars;** choose one format or
   always use both. For example, either use *feet* and *hands*, or
   *foot, feet* and *hand, hands*.
-  **Be consistent in how you describe an action or activity.** For
   instance, either use *running* and *swimming*, or *run, running* and
   *swim, swimming*.
-  **Don’t be too narrow.** *Keokuk, IA* may be too narrow for a keyword
   and completely unrecognizable to any of your users — *Southeast Iowa*
   would be better.
-  **Conversely, don’t be too broad.** *University* may be too broad,
   because perhaps everything in your |acquia-product:dam| collection
   relates to the University. What will distinguish the assets in this
   scenario? Try using the specific college name, such as *College of
   Engineering*, or the campus building name.
-  **Be mindful of relevance.** Just because every asset has a project
   code associated with it does not mean it offers relevance to the
   users relying on keywords to find assets. If this information needs
   to stay with the asset nonetheless, consider adding it into another
   metadata field.
-  **Don’t use too few keywords,** otherwise they won’t help narrow the
   results.
-  **Avoid misspellings.** Implementing a controlled vocabulary that has
   been copyedited will help with this.
-  **Don’t rely on keywords for every piece of data.** More objective
   data such as photographer name, location, or designer name can be
   added to other metadata fields.

One last note — **always have your use cases in mind** when adding
keywords. This will keep your efforts focused. Fill in this sentence
when considering a keyword:

*How likely is it that [insert person/role] will search by [insert
keyword] when looking for [insert asset]?*

Going through this exercise will help you consider others’ perspectives
when adding keywords.
