Projects in Workstream
======================

Projects are a collection of tasks. They allow you to organize and
manage multi-faceted workflows in one location. Administrators and
contributors can assign multiple tasks to a project as well as pull
assets directly from your DAM and assign them to projects.


Create Projects
---------------

Administrators can create new projects.

#. Log in to Workstream.
#. Click **Projects** on the navigation. Click **+New Project** in the
   top right-hand side of the screen.
#. You will be prompted to provide the following:

   -  User Groups with access to the project – enter the contributor
      group(s) that you’d like to allow to view and edit the project.
   -  Project Name
   -  Project Sponsor – the sponsor manages the details of the project.
   -  Launch Date
   -  Project Description

#. Click **Create**.
#. A new, unique project ID will be automatically assigned to your
   project. Project ID's are noted by a "P" preceding the ID number and
   are located above the name of the project.

Administrators can also create a project from a task or move a task to
or from an existing project. (Read more `about
tasks </dam/workstream/tasks>`__.)


Edit Projects
-------------

Administrators can view and edit all projects, while contributors can
view and edit the projects that they have permission to view.

Projects can be edited from the project details page:

#. Log in to Workstream.
#. Click Projects on the navigation bar.
#. Click the project that you want to edit.


Edit Project Name and Description
---------------------------------

In the project details page, hover your mouse over the project name or
description and click to inline edit.

|Change product name|

Click anywhere on the page to save. A confirmation pop-up in the lower
right-hand corner of the screen.


Edit Project Sponsor
--------------------

#. In the project details page, hover your mouse over the **Project
   Sponsor** section and click the |Options| **Options** icon.
#. Click **Edit Sponsor**.
#. Type in the name or email address of the user and click their name
   when it appears in the dropdown.
#. Click **Save**.
#. The assignee will receive a notification that they are the new
   project sponsor.


Contact Project Sponsor
-----------------------

If there is an update or change to the project requirements, you may
want to send a personalized message to the project sponsor.

#. In the project details page, hover your mouse over the **Project
   Sponsor** section and click the |Options| **Options** icon.
#. Click **Contact Sponsor**. You will only see **Contact Sponsor** if
   the project sponsor is someone other than yourself.
#. Enter the message and then click **Send**.


Edit Completion
---------------

The completion section of the project automatically updates as tasks
assigned to the project are marked complete. (Read more about
`tasks </dam/workstream/tasks>`__ and `updating
statuses </dam/workstream/getting-started>`__ here.)

Admins can manually mark a project as complete. Hover over the |Options|
**Options** icon on the project list page, next to the project name in
the project details page, or next to the completion percentage on the
project details page. Select **Mark project complete**. You can also
reverse this action by selecting **Mark project active**.

   Date** section and click the |Options| **Options** icon.
#. Click **Change Launch Date**.
#. Select a new date and **Save**.


Edit Watchers
-------------

Adding Watchers to a project is a good way to keep relevant people
informed of the progress of a project. Watchers receive notifications if
there are certain updates or changes to the project.

Add a watcher:

#. In the project details page, hover your mouse over the **Watchers**
   section.
#. Click the ``(+)`` **Plus** icon.
#. Type in the name or email address of the user. Click his or her name
   once it appears in the dropdown.
#. Enter an optional message.
#. Click **Save**.

To delete a watcher, hover your mouse over the watcher’s name and click
the ``(X)`` **Close** icon.


Edit Assets
-----------

You can assign locally stored assets or assets from your DAM to a
project.

Any assets assigned to a project from your computer or desktop will
automatically be uploaded to a folder in the DAM titled **Workstream
Assets**. (Read more about the `Workstream Assets folder </dam/workstream/getting-started>`__.)

If a task includes assets, they will appear in the **Assets** section
under the name of the task.

There are a few ways to assign assets to projects:

#. In the **Project details** page, drag and drop assets into the
   **Assets** section.
#. In the **Project details** page, hover your mouse over the **Assets**
   section and click the ``(+)`` **Plus** icon.
#. Click **Add from |acquia-product:dam|** to select assets currently in
   the DAM.
#. Click **Add from Computer** to select assets from your computer.
#. To remove an asset: Hover your mouse over the asset and by click the
   ``(X)`` **Close** icon.
   |Remove an asset|

.. note::
  This will remove the asset from the task, but it will not delete the
  asset from the **Workstream Assets** folder.


Edit Active Tasks
-----------------

Active tasks are tasks that are still in progress.

      **Active Tasks** section and click the + icon.

      (Read more `about Request Forms </dam/workstream/request>`__.)
   -  Complete the form. Click **Save for Later** to save a draft or
      click **Submit** to finish adding the task. This will create a new
      task.

based on the facet chosen.
