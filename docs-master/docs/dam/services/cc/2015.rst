After ensuring that you meet the `installation
requirements </dam/services/cc>`__, to install the Adobe Creative Cloud
(CC2015) connector, complete the following steps:

#. Exit all Adobe programs.
#. Use the appropriate procedure to install the Connector, based on your
   operating system:

   -  *MacOS*

      #. Download and install the ZXPInstaller application. This
         application uses the same Adobe installation subsystem as Adobe
         AddOns.

         #. Go to `zxpinstaller.com <http://zxpinstaller.com>`__
         #. Click **Download for OS X**.
         #. Click the .dmg file in the download bar at the bottom of
            your browser.

            |DMG file|

         #. When the ZXPINstaller window displays, drag the ZXPInstaller
            to your Applications folder.

            |Drag to Applications folder|

         #. Open ZXPInstaller from your Applications folder.
            (ZXPInstaller is not currently available on the Mac App
            Store, so your security settings may not allow you to open
            it. To change your settings, open your **System
            Preferences** and click **Security & Privacy**. Under "Allow
            apps downloaded from:" select **Anywhere**. (Some companies
            require IT to change this setting for you.)
         #. Download the ``.zxp`` file.

            .. important::
              Do *not* double-click the ``.zxp`` files or attempt to
              install using the Adobe CC Extension Manager — it will
              corrupt your installation. Adobe CC Extension Manager was
              discontinued with the CC 2014 release.

      #. Install the ``.zxp`` file, by either dragging the file into
         the window, or by clicking in the window and then selecting
         the ``.zxp`` file. |br|
         ZXPInstaller will start installing the CC extensions in the
         ``.zxp`` file. |br|
         If the installation fails, be sure that you have Adobe
         Creative Cloud, and not a version of Adobe Creative Suite.
         The Connector is not compatible with Creative Suite.

         |Installing on a Mac|

   -  *Microsoft Windows*

      #. Download the
         `WebDAMCCConnector.exe <https://www.damsuccess.com/hc/article_attachments/206095843/WebDAMCCConnector.exe>`__
         file.
      #. Click the .exe file in the download bar at the bottom of your
         browser. You may get a “Windows protected your PC” warning
         because it’s an unrecognized file – if so, click **More info**
         then **Run anyway**.

#. Open InDesign, Illustrator or Photoshop.
#. Click **Window** in the top navigation, then select **Extensions >
   Acquia DAM CC Connector**.
#. After you open the panel, enter your |acquia-product:dam|
   credentials.
