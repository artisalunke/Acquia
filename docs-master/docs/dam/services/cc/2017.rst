After ensuring that you meet the `installation
requirements </dam/services/cc>`__, to install the Adobe Creative Cloud
(CC2017) connector, complete the following steps:

#.  Exit all Adobe programs.

#.  Download the appropriate installation file, based on your operating
    system:

    -  `macOS connector package <https://siliconpublishingdev.app.box.com/s/srujd0aqdhesumuddvssewtzj4a9n4kn>`__
    -  `Microsoft Windows connector package <https://siliconpublishingdev.app.box.com/s/s631yppocavyuelglu7cde9vfbqsraeb>`__

#.  Open the file, and then follow its instructions.

#.  After you have installed the |acquia-product:dam| Connector for Adobe
    Creative Cloud 2017, you will need to reset InDesign's preferences. To
    do this, complete the following steps:

    #.  Start InDesign, and then press the following keys, based on your
        operating system:

        -  *MacOS* - ``Shift+Option+Command+Control``
        -  *Windows* - ``Shift+Ctrl+Alt``

    #.  Click **Yes** when asked if you want to delete preference files.
        If the alert does not appear, you were too late in holding down the
        keys. Quit InDesign and try again.

#.  Open the |acquia-product:dam| panel after installation.

#.  Open InDesign, Illustrator, or Photoshop.

#.  Click **Window** in the top navigation, and then go to **Extensions >
    Acquia DAM CC Connector**.

#.  After you open the panel, enter your |acquia-product:dam| credentials.

Uninstall Adobe Creative Cloud Connector
----------------------------------------

Silicon Connector installers should remove any previous versions for
you, so these steps are not needed if you're performing an install.

If you are having troubles installing Connector, if Connector is not
displaying or launching properly or if you simply need to remove it from
your system completely, you may need to manually remove Connector files
before installing again.

If you are removing Silicon Connector permanently, remember to
deactivate your license prior to uninstalling.

.. _mac-uninstall:

Uninstalling on macOS
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Remove the Connector extension folder in
``/Library/Application Support/Adobe/CEP/extensions/``

.. note::
  This is in the System Library folder, and not the user Library folder.

Remove the Connector plug-in folder in
``/Applications/Adobe InDesign CC 2015/Plug-Ins/``, for example
``/Applications/Adobe InDesign CC 2015/Plug-Ins/SiliconConnectorBox``

Only one version of the plug-ins for Silicon Connector can be present in
the ``/Applications/Adobe InDesign CC 2015/Plug-Ins`` folder at a time.
If you have previously installed another version of Silicon Connector,
you must remove the corresponding folders to prevent these plug-ins from
conflicting with the plug-ins you're installing.

There are some preference files that can be removed as well. You can
delete ``/Users/username/Library/Preferences/SiliconConnector`` but be
aware, this will remove preferences for any Silicon Connector you have
installed, including licensing information.

Silicon Connector will use a folder in your **Documents** folder for
local caching of thumbnails and some other files. You can delete it as
well. For example, Silicon Connector for Box will create a folder called
``box_connector_files``.

.. _windows-uninstall:

Uninstalling on Windows
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The installer is a standard Windows installation program, so it creates
an uninstaller. So, instead of removing the files manually, you can use
the Windows Control Panel. Go to **Control Panel > Programs and Features
> Uninstall a Program** and uninstall Silicon Connector.
