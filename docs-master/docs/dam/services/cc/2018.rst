(CC2018) connector, complete the following steps:

#.  Exit all Adobe programs.

#.  Download the appropriate installation file for your operating system:

    -  `macOS connector package <https://library.webdamdb.com/directdownload.php?ti=4106552&tok=r24bW0TI5y73dNl9zLwOKARR>`__
    -  `Microsoft Windows connector package <https://library.webdamdb.com/directdownload.php?ti=4106518&tok=L7IpEwdDhzGpiRBkmnUdrwRR>`__

#.  After you have installed the |acquia-product:dam| Connector for Adobe
    Creative Cloud 2018, you will need to reset InDesign's preferences by
    completing the following steps:

    #.  Start InDesign, and then immediately press the following keys, based
        on your operating system:

        -  *macOS* - ``Shift + Option + Command + Control``
        -  *Windows* - ``Shift + Ctrl + Alt``

    #.  When asked if you want to delete preference files, click **Yes**.
        If the alert does not appear, you were too late in holding down the
        keys. Quit InDesign and try again.

your system completely, you may need to manually remove Connector files
before installing again.

  The 2018 installer should remove any previous versions of the connector
  for you, so these steps are not needed if you're performing an install.
