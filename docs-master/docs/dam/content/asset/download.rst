Downloading assets
------------------

You can download a single asset or a group of assets.

-  Select the asset(s) you want to download. (For multiple assets, hold
   down the ``Ctrl`` key on a PC or the ``Command`` key on a Mac.)
-  Click the **Download** button on the actions toolbar.

Set the `desired preset </dam/content/asset/download#preset>`__,
**crop** (if applicable), and then click **Submit**.

If you are downloading multiple assets, the download will be packaged as
a .ZIP file and may take a few moments to generate. An email will be
sent once the download is ready.

Desired presets
---------------

You can convert assets upon download by choosing a desired preset
configured by the system admin from the dropdown and/or creating your
own custom preset. These options depend on the group permissions. (Read
more about `configuring users and groups </dam/admin/users>`__.)

To create a custom preset:

#. Choose **Custom** from the desired preset.
#. Select the file format from the dropdown.
#. Set the resolution, dimensions and color space as needed. If left
   blank, the file will retain its original setting when downloaded.
#. If youâ€™d like to save the preset for future use, check the box next
   to **Save these settings** and enter a name for the setting.
