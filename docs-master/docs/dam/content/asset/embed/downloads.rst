Embeddable: Downloads
=====================

.. container:: message-status

  *This feature is available only to |acquia-product:dam| Professional
  subscribers.*

Embeddables are bundles of code that embed assets on third-party
platforms like Wordpress, Drupal, |acquia-product:bc|, and anywhere else
you can embed code.

Embeddable downloads give you the added option to embed a thumbnail plus
a link to download the asset. You can track where the assets are
embedded and how many times the asset has been downloaded.

**Example**: You display your products on your website, including
downloadable brochures that explain the product in more depth. With
embeddable downloads, you grab an embed code for a brochure directly
from your DAM. This code is then embedded on your website, allowing you
to embed a thumbnail of the selected brochure.

The code also lets customers download the brochure on your website while
hosting it in your DAM â€“ no more staging servers, FTP sites, etc.
required. If you update or change the brochure in your DAM, the changes
are reflected on your website to that visitors are always downloading
the latest version or seeing the latest thumbnail.
