|acquia-product:aj| is a customer journey orchestration engine that
provides both a visual journey map and intelligent tools to unify
customer data, monitor their activity, and deliver best-next actions and
offers in real time, across any channel or touchpoint—all while being
integrated with Acquia’s hosting and software platform.

Brands can increase effectiveness with |acquia-product:aj| by providing
tools to support customer journeys that extend throughout the customer
lifecycle: *pre-purchase* (marketing phase), *at purchase* (conversion
phase), and *post-purchase* or post-engagement (service, support,
up/cross sell phase).

.. _how:

How |acquia-product:aj| works
-----------------------------

|acquia-product:aj| provides a visual customer journey mapping tool with
two primary modes: *Strategy* and *Execution*.

First, when building a journey in the *strategy* mode, users can create
the desired, intended, or actual journey of customers using a simple
drag and drop tool, allowing them to connect touchpoints, personas,
content, and whatever other elements make up this customer journey. This
tool is used for planning, but also is associated with metrics which are
overlaid on the journey once it’s live, as well as tied into the
execution layer.

In the *execution* mode, the same visual tools are used to build the
underlying journey logic. This includes integrations, decisioning
capabilities, data transformations, and much more. Although
|acquia-product:aj| includes several tools that allow a marketer to
perform actions that would be otherwise left completely to a developer,
there are also tools explicitly available to developers that allow them
to save time and focus on the business logic required to execute the
journey.
