#. **Service Level Policy** |br| 
   This Service Level Policy governs the use of |acquia-product:dam| under the terms of the applicable Order between Acquia and Customer.

   7.1 **Service Commitment** |br| 
      Acquia will use commercially reasonable efforts to make |acquia-product:dam| available for 99.95% during any calendar month during the applicable Subscription Term (the “Service Commitment”). In the event Acquia does not meet the Service Commitment, Customer will be eligible to receive a Service Extension as described in the following sections.
   7.2 **Definitions** |br| 
      *Availability* will be calculated per calendar month, as follows:

      |Availability formula|

      Where:

      - *total* - The total number of minutes for the calendar quarter.
      - *nonexcluded* - Downtime/unavailability that is not excluded
      - *excluded* - The Service Commitment exclusions defined below.

      *Unavailability* means that the SaaS infrastructure is unresponsive or responds with an error.

   7.3 **Service Extension** |br| 
      In the event that Acquia does not meet 99.95% general availability of |acquia-product:dam| for a calendar quarter, for each one-half hour of unavailability Customer will receive one-day extension of their Subscription (each a “Service Extension”). To properly claim a Service Extension, Customer must inform Acquia within 15 days of the purported outage and provide a description of the service interruption. If Customer has accumulated Service Extensions during two consecutive months or three months in any six-month period, Customer may terminate the applicable Order upon seven days advance written notice to Acquia. In the event any Unavailability of |acquia-product:dam| is directly attributable to flaws in Customer’s environment (including the underlying code) where, despite reasonable notification from Acquia that such flaws are adversely impacting availability and Customer fails to correct such flaws, then Acquia may terminate the applicable Order upon 30-days written notice to Customer. The Service Extensions and termination rights constitute Customer’s exclusive remedy and Acquia’s sole liability and obligation for any failure to maintain the Service Commitment.
   7.4 **Service Commitment Exclusions** |br| 
      The Service Commitment does not apply to any Unavailability, outage, suspension or termination of any |acquia-product:dam| performance issues:

      - Any planned downtime (not to exceed 36 hours in any calendar quarter) of which Acquia gives 24 or more hours’ notice in accordance with the Agreement or via a conspicuous on-screen message in the Services. Acquia will use commercially reasonable efforts to schedule all planned downtime during the hours from 6:00 p.m. Friday to 3:00 a.m. Monday, U.S. Pacific Time.
      - Any unavailability caused by circumstances beyond Acquia’s reasonable control, including, without limitation, acts of God, acts of government, flood, fire, earthquakes, civil unrest, acts of terror, strikes or other labor problems (other than those involving Acquia’s employees), or third party internet service provider failures or delays (other than those Internet Service Providers under contract with Acquia).

        * This also includes unavailability that relates to any malware, viruses, Trojan horses, spyware, worms, or other malicious or harmful code in the website that (1) was not introduced by Acquia or (2) was not introduced as a result of Acquia’s failure to perform the Services in compliance with the standard included herein or in the Agreement; or (v) acts or omissions caused by Customer’s CDN.

        In the event of any outages described above, Acquia will use commercially reasonable efforts to minimize any disruption, inaccessibility and/or inoperability of the website in connection with outages, whether scheduled or not.

      For any partial calendar quarter during which Customer subscribes to the Services, availability will be calculated based on the entire calendar quarter, not just the portion for which Customer subscribed.
