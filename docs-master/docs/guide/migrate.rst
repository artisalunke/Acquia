Acquia Platform Migration Services Product Guide
================================================

**Last updated: November 2, 2016**

#. **Migration Services**

   If included in Customer’s Order, Acquia will migrate Customer’s
   existing Code Base to the |acquia-product:ac| platform. Prior to
   Acquia performing Migration Services, Customer shall ensure that its
   website is running on a version of PHP supported by Acquia as defined
   in the Support Users Guide. Customer shall provide Acquia with an
   administrative login to the Code Base to be migrated and have a
   technical point of contact that is familiar with Drupal. Migration
   Services include:

   -  Initial, intermediate and final migration of a single Code Base,
      database, and associated file assets. Acquia will provide up to
      three syncs of the website during the migration.
   -  Configuration changes to settings.php to connect to
      |acquia-product:ac|.
   -  A basic review of Customer’s existing Drupal site configuration,
      module selection, and code for potential availability risks.
   -  Migration regressions root cause analysis and recommendations.
   -  Installation of the |acquia-product:anc| and |acquia-product:as|.
   -  Core and contributed module major version security upgrades.

   Acquia Platform Migration Services are performed remotely by Acquia
   and Acquia will require an administrative login to Customer’s
   website. Customer agrees to cooperate with Acquia to the extent
   necessary for Acquia to perform the services and shall provide Acquia
   with access to Customer's personnel. Once migrated, Acquia will
   conduct a light infrastructure site audit to determine whether any
   issues with the website may cause the launch to be unsuccessful.
   Following such audit, Acquia will disclose any launch blockers to
   Customer. Customer may either fix the launch blockers itself or
   engage Acquia at its standard professional services rates to fix the
   blockers. Any delays resulting from Customer’s failure to perform or
   fulfill its responsibilities (e.g., not having systems ready or
   failing to provide necessary data) will not affect the term of the
   applicable services or the payment schedule. Customer may purchase a
   full infrastructure site audit for an additional fee and subject to a
   separate Order.

   In the event Acquia determines that additional storage or servers are
   insufficient to properly migrate Customer’s website, Acquia will
   inform Customer and Acquia will provision the additional necessary
   storage or capacity at Customer’s expense.

   Migrations are available as noted below in small, medium, and large
   options, depending on the size and complexity of Customer’s project.
   Customers should anticipate at least four weeks to complete platform
   migration.

#. **Migration Train Your Team**

   If included in Customer’s Order, Acquia will spend up to six hours
   training Customer in the basic use of Acquia’s migration tools and
   processes, including Git and Drush, to enable Customer to move its
   website(s) to the Acquia platform. An Acquia engineer will work with
   Customer to identify the best migration process for Customer
   requirements, including elements of the process that can be automated
   for repeatability and consistency across the full range of website(s)
   Customer intends to migrate.
