**Last updated: November 2, 2016**

If included in Customer’s Order, Acquia will provide to Customer a
dedicated, logically isolated section of |acquia-product:ace| with a
customizable network configuration. Customer instances within this
isolated Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) will not be shared with any other
customers and can only be accessed by other instances within the same
isolated VPC.

Customer can choose to add a Virtual Private Network (VPN) hosted on
|acquia-product:ace| to facilitate a high availability, bi-directional
IPSec LAN-to-LAN VPN connection between |acquia-product:ace| and
Customer’s private network. The VPN connection will provide Customer
with a secure bi-directional interaction between its website and their
internal IT systems (e.g. CRM). The Acquia VPN set-up fee includes
configuration of the connection between |acquia-product:ace| and one
Customer-defined gateway device point. Customer must purchase a
subscription to |acquia-product:ace| to enable the VPN.

In the event Customer changes endpoints during the Subscription Term,
Customer will incur additional set-up fees, which will be billed to
Customer at $250 per hour. In order for Acquia to enable the VPN
connection, Customer must meet the technical requirements set forth at
http://aws.amazon.com/vpc/faqs/#C9.
