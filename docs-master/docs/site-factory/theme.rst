In Drupal, your website's
`theme <%5Bacquia-product:kb%5Darticles/theme-definition>`__ is how the
different visual elements that make up your website are combined and
placed. It includes the available regions that you can use, different
layouts on different pages, and the selection of colors, fonts, and
graphics. |acquia-product:edg| provides the following methods to theme
your website:

-  *Use an external Git repository* - 
   If you are a PaaS subscription customer, you can associate an
   external Git repository that contains one or more Drupal themes for
   use with your website. After you connect your website to a theme
   repository, you can view and select its themes by clicking
   **Appearance** in the admin menu.
   For more information about connecting to an external theme
   repository, see `Adding external themes to your site </site-factory/theme/external>`__.
-  *Manually theme your website* - 
   |acquia-product:edg| subscription customers have the ability to
   manually theme their websites in manners similar to other Drupal
   websites.
