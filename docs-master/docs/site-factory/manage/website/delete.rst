Deleting a site
===============

.. important::  

   The information on this page describes how to remove a website from
   |acquia-product:edg|.

If you want to remove your account from an Acquia subscription or
acquia.com, `contact Acquia Support </support#contact>`__, and request
that they delete your account.

If you no longer require a website that you administer, you can delete
the website from |acquia-product:edg|.


Things to consider
------------------

-  Deleting a website is **permanent** and cannot be undone.
-  Deleting your website does not delete your account or your website's
   user accounts.
-  If you want to save a copy of the website for later use, `back up the
   website </site-factory/manage/website/backup>`__ and download the
   backup before you delete it.
-  If you delete a website, you cannot reuse its name for a website in
   the same |acquia-product:edg| subscription.
