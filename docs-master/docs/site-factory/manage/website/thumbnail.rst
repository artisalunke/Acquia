Refreshing website thumbnail images
===================================

The |acquia-product:sfi| sites, site collections, and groups pages
display thumbnail images of the front pages of your websites to make it
easier to identify the websites you want to work with. If the content of
a website has changed, the thumbnail image may become out of date. If
you want to update the thumbnail image, you can refresh it to show the
current front page content by `clearing the
caches </site-factory/manage/website/cache>`__ for the website. Be
aware, however, that clearing a website's caches can have a negative
effect on its performance and if your website is receiving a significant
amount of traffic, the effect can be severe.
