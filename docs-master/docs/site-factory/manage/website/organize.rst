Organizing your websites, collections, and groups
=================================================

|acquia-product:edg| includes `site
collections </site-factory/manage/website/site-coll>`__ and
`groups </site-factory/manage/website/groups-create>`__ that you can use
to organize your websites. As you create more and more of all of these
objects, it can become difficult to keep track of them. For example, you
may be scanning the |acquia-product:sfi| when you see *testwebsite*. It
may be unclear whether that is a website or a site collection. It is
also unclear what the word *test* refers to.

You can potentially avoid confusion and improve a development team's
ability to collaborate by using standardized conventions to organize
your websites, site collections, and groups.

Use the following recommendations as you name objects in the
|acquia-product:sfi|:

-  **Websites**

   -  Include the website's site name in the website object's name.
   -  Use only letters and numbers in your website object name.
   -  If you are working with multiple copies of a website for
      development, add the creation date to the end of the website name
      (for example, ``mywebsite20161010`` for a website created on
      October 10, 2016).

-  **Site collections**

   -  Include the primary website's site name in the site collection's
      object name.
   -  Use only letters and numbers in your site collection object name.
   -  Add ``collection`` to the end of the site collection name (for
      example, ``mywebsitecollection``).

-  **Groups**

   -  Create groups that separate websites and site collections in a way
      that mirrors your organization's structure. Examples include
      organizational units (such as *Finance*, *Marketing*, or
      *Support*) and geographic regions (including *North America*,
      *Europe*, or *Asia/Pacific*).
   -  Use descriptive terms that help users easily identify group
      contents, moving from a general term for top-level groups to a
      more specific term as you create subgroups.

      For example:

      -  North America

         -  United States

            -  Massachusetts
