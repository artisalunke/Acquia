Managing user permissions
=========================

|acquia-product:sfi| users have several roles that determine what
permissions they possess to perform actions in the |acquia-product:sfi|
and websites. These roles are described in |sfiroles|_.


.. |sfiroles| replace:: \ |acquia-product:sfi|\  roles
.. _sfiroles: /site-factory/users/admin

Using the **Manage permissions** page, a user with the `Platform
admin </site-factory/users/admin/platform-admin>`__ role can customize
how users with certain roles can access the following features:

-  *Setting the primary website of a site collection* - By default,
   available to Platform admin and `Site
   builder </site-factory/users/admin/site-builder>`__ roles
-  *Managing domains for websites and site collections* - By default,
   available to Platform admin and Site builder roles

To configure these permissions, complete the following steps:

#. Sign in to the |acquia-product:sfi| using an account with the
   Platform admin role.
#. In the admin menu, click **Administration**, and then click the
   **Manage permissions** link.
#. Select the permissions that you want to set for the displayed
