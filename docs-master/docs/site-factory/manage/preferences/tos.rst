Setting the terms of service statement
======================================

As an administrator, you can define default text used by all websites to
tell people where your Terms of Service (TOS) page is located or provide
a link to the TOS page. You can also override your default text on a
per-website basis.

Configuring the default TOS page
--------------------------------

To configure the default text for your websites' Terms of Service:

#. `Sign in </site-factory/manage/login>`__ to |acquia-product:edg| 
   using an account with the |platform admin|_ role.
#. In the admin menu, click **Preferences**.
#. Click the **Terms of Service** link.
#. Enter or edit the default Terms of Service text for your websites.
#. Click **Save configuration**.

.. |platform admin| replace:: *Platform admin*
.. _platform admin: /site-factory/users/admin/platform-admin

Configuring the per-site TOS
----------------------------

There is an option on each website node to configure a custom TOS for
the website.

#. `Sign in </site-factory/manage/login>`__ to |acquia-product:edg|,
   find the website for which you want to create a custom TOS, and then
   open its actions menu.

   |Site actions menu|

#. Select **Configure Terms of Service**.
#. Enter the TOS text that you want to use with this website.
#. Click **Save**.

.. note::  

   Your other websites will continue to use either the default TOS or their
   own website-specific TOS.
