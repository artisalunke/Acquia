Acquia Cloud Site Factory 2.53
-------------------------------------

*21 December 2016*

This release of |acquia-product:edg| is scheduled for release on
December 21, 2016. It contains the following updates:

Features
~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  **Dynamic request (page views) reports**
   You can now view and download reports about dynamic requests served
   on a monthly basis. Dynamic request reports are part of the
   **Administration > Subscription Usage** page in the
   |acquia-product:sfi|. The Site Factory REST API includes a new
   ``Dynamic requests`` method
   (```GET /api/v1/dynamic-requests/monthly`` <https://www.demo.acquia-cc.com/api/v1#List-monthly-aggregated-dynamic-request-statistics.>`__)
   that you can use to obtain more detailed dynamic request reports.
   `Learn more </site-factory/manage/usage>`__.
-  **Improved handling of private files configuration**
   |acquia-product:edg| now supports the use of private files in
   operations such as site cloning and site deletion. The private files
   directory for newly created websites is now set to a location outside
   the docroot, on the file system at
   ``/mnt/files/[sitegroup].[env]/sites/g/files-private/[database name]``.
   If you use a private files directory other than the default one,
   those files will not be included in site backups or site
   duplications. This feature requires `|acquia-product:edg|
   Connector <https://www.drupal.org/project/acsf>`__ module version
   7.x-1.34 or 8.x-1.34 or later.

Changes
~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  A user who clones a site becomes the site owner for that site, rather
   than the owner of the original site.
-  The Audit log, which users with the *Platform admin* role can view in
   the |acquia-product:sfi| on the **Administration > Logs > Audit Log**
   page, now uses pagination, so that you can more easily find older log
   entries.

Acquia Cloud Site Factory 2.52
-------------------------------------

*29 November 2016*

This release of |acquia-product:edg| is scheduled for release on
November 29, 2016. It contains the following updates:

Feature
~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  **Assign and remove domains with the REST API**
   The Site Factory REST API contains new methods that enable you to:

   -  List domains for a website or site collection - ``Get domains``
      (`GET
      /api/v1/domains/{node\_id} <https://www.demo.acquia-cc.com/api/v1#Get-domains>`__)
   -  Assign a domain name to a website or site collection -
      ``Add domain`` (`POST
      /api/v1/domains/{node\_id}/add <https://www.demo.acquia-cc.com/api/v1#Add-domain>`__)
   -  Remove a domain name from a website or site collection -
      ``Remove domain`` (`POST
      /api/v1/domains/{node\_id}/remove <https://www.demo.acquia-cc.com/api/v1#Remove-domain>`__).

Changes
~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  Website backups that would result in a backup file larger than 5 GB
   now fail with an error message. `Learn
   more </site-factory/manage/website/backup>`__.
-  A new ``post-theme-deploy`` Factory hook has been added to better
   support remote themes for Drupal 8. Without this Factory hook, when
   deploying an updated theme from an external repository, sometimes the
   theme update will not take effect on all web servers. `Learn
   more </site-factory/theme/external#refresh>`__.

Fixed issues
~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  In some circumstances, duplicating websites failed for some Drupal 8
   websites. (DG-16356)
-  Users could not sign in to newly staged environments in some cases.
   (DG-16435)
-  When attempting to sign in on Drupal 8, the sign in failed with the
   following error:
   ``Error(s) encountered during processing of ACS response. Type(s): invalid_response; reason given for last error: Unsigned SAML Response that contains a signed and encrypted Assertion with encrypted nameId is not supported.``
   (DG-16502)

Acquia Cloud Site Factory 2.51
-------------------------------------

*8 November 2016*

This release of |acquia-product:edg| is scheduled for release on
November 8, 2016. It contains the following updates:

Feature
~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  **Include embedded paths with your websites' domain names**
   You can now create path-based custom domains for websites, in the
   form ``www.example.com/foo`` and ``www.example.com/bar``. Previously,
   you could create custom subdomains in the form ``foo.example.com`` or
   ``bar.example.com``.
   Using this feature requires both using the appropriate
   |acquia-product:edg| Connector module included with this release for
   your environment, and creating a symlink in your docroot for each
   such website. For more information, see `Using path-based domain
   names </site-factory/manage/website/domains/path>`__.

Changes
~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  In the |acquia-product:sfi|, you can now sort websites by the date
   created.
-  Staging a non-primary website from a site collection stages only the
   primary website and the requested website — not all of the websites
   in the site collection. When you stage the primary website, only the
   primary website will be staged.
-  The |acquia-product:edg| Connector module has been updated to the
   following versions:

   -  Drupal 8 -
      `8.x-1.33 <https://www.drupal.org/project/acsf/releases/8.x-1.33>`__
   -  Drupal 7 -
      `7.x-1.33 <https://www.drupal.org/project/acsf/releases/7.x-1.33>`__

Fixed issues
~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  When a site collection was moved to a new site group, users with the
   *Site builder* role could not view the site collection, but only its
   primary website. (DG-16344)
-  In some circumstances, the ``List sites`` method
   (``GET /api/v1/sites``) in the REST API returned an incorrect website
   count. (DG-16357)

Acquia Cloud Site Factory 2.50
-------------------------------------

*18 October 2016*

This release of |acquia-product:edg| is scheduled for release on October
18, 2016. It contains the following updates:

Features
~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  **Monitor task status with the REST API**
   The Site Factory REST API contains a new method, `Task
   status <https://www.demo.acquia-cc.com/api/v1#Wip-task-status>`__
   (``GET /api/v1/wip/task/%task_id/status``), which, given a task ID,
   returns the status of the task, including, among other data, the task
   name, task group name, and start and end timestamps. This method can
   help you debug and monitor the status of tasks such as site backups.
-  **Get references to deployable branches or tags with the REST API**
   The Site Factory REST API contains a new method, `List deployable
   refs <https://www.demo.acquia-cc.com/api/v1#List-deployable-refs>`__
   (``GET /api/v1/vcs``), which returns a list of all deployable
   branches and tags in your Site Factory code repository, as well as
   the currently deployed branch or tag. You can use the ``stack_id``
   request parameter to limit the list to branches or tags on one Site
   Factory Stack.
-  **Get a list of available Stacks with the REST API**
   The Site Factory REST API contains a new method, `Get list of
   available
   stacks <https://www.demo.acquia-cc.com/api/v1#Get-list-of-available-stacks.>`__
   (``GET /api/v1/stacks``), which returns a list of all of your
   |acquia-product:edg| Stacks.

Changes
~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  The REST API `List
   sites <https://www.demo.acquia-cc.com/api/v1#List-sites>`__ and `Site
   details <https://www.demo.acquia-cc.com/api/v1#Site-details>`__
   methods now return additional information about a website's site
   collection, including whether the website is in a site collection,
   the ID of its site collection, and whether it is the primary website
   in a site collection. The ``Site details`` method additionally
   returns the domain names of its site collection.
-  Errors from the Staging environment are now also displayed in the
   Production environment's |acquia-product:sfi|.

Acquia Cloud Site Factory 2.49.2
-------------------------------------

*27 September 2016*

This hotfix release of |acquia-product:edg| contains the following
update:

Fixed issue
~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  When a new domain was added to a site collection, the task would
   fail. This was due to an error introduced in the |acquia-product:edg|
   2.49 release and required a rollback of a fix to a different issue.
   As a result, when a site collection is moved to a new site group,
   users with the Site builder role cannot view the site collection, but
   only its primary site. (DG-16342, DG-15882)

Acquia Cloud Site Factory 2.49
-------------------------------------

*27 September 2016*

This release of |acquia-product:edg| is scheduled for release on
September 27, 2016. It contains the following updates:

Feature
~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  **Ensure that only Platform admins can be site owners**
   By default, the person who creates a website becomes the site owner,
   which can provide the website creator greater authority than may you
   want. You can now configure |acquia-product:edg| so that for any
   sites created by a user who does not have the *Platform admin* role,
   the *Platform admin* user you specify will become the site owner.
   `Learn more </site-factory/users/site-owner>`__.

Changes
~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  The Site Factory REST API `List
   groups <https://www.demo.acquia-cc.com/api/v1#List-groups>`__ method
   (``GET /api/v1/groups``) now returns the total number of websites or
   site collections and the number of live websites or site collections
   for each group. The values returned do not include websites in
   subgroups.
-  An |acquia-product:edg| codebase can now more easily be deployed on
   |acquia-product:ace|. When you next run ``acsf-init``,
   |acquia-product:edg| adds a new file, ``acsf.settings.php``, which
   ensures that the same codebase can use appropriate settings on either
   |acquia-product:edg| or |acquia-product:ace|. The
   |acquia-product:edg| file should not be modified or moved.
-  The |acquia-product:edg| Connector module can now be moved to a
   different directory. It is a good practice to keep the module in a
   consistent place, and it is important not to install the module in
   more than one location in your codebase.
-  The |acquia-product:edg| Connector module has been updated to
   versions
   `8.x-1.31 <https://www.drupal.org/project/acsf/releases/8.x-1.31>`__
   and
   `7.x-1.31 <https://www.drupal.org/project/acsf/releases/7.x-1.31>`__.

Fixed issues
~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  When a site collection was moved to a new site group, users with the
   *Site builder* role could not view the site collection, but only its
   primary website. (DG-15882)
-  A user with the *Site builder* role who was not the site owner could
   transfer ownership of a website. (DG-16243)

Acquia Cloud Site Factory 2.48
----------------------------------------

*7 September 2016*

This release of |acquia-product:edg| is scheduled for release on
September 7, 2016. It contains the following updates:

   |acquia-product:edg| now supports single sign-on from the
   |acquia-product:sfi| to Drupal 8 websites managed by
   |acquia-product:edg|. Previously, this feature was available only for
   Drupal 7 websites. `Learn more </site-factory/manage/sso>`__.

Changes
~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  The |acquia-product:edg| Connector module has been updated to version
   `7.x-1.28 <https://www.drupal.org/project/acsf/releases/7.x-1.28>`__
   and version
   `8.x-1.28 <https://www.drupal.org/project/acsf/releases/8.x-1.28>`__.
-  After a website is transferred to a new site owner, and the new site
   owner signs in to the hosted website, they are given the
   administrative role on the hosted website. This change applies only
   to Drupal 7 websites and requires |acquia-product:edg| Connector
   module version 7.x-1.28 or later.
-  |acquia-product:edg| now supports the Drupal ``trusted_host_pattern``
   setting, which provides improved security against HTTP Host header
   manipulation.

Fixed issue
~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  Website backups failed if there was a ThemeBuilder session open at
   the time of the backup. (DG-16184)

Acquia Cloud Site Factory 2.47.1
-------------------------------------

*25 August 2016*

This hotfix release of |acquia-product:edg| contains the following
update:

Change

August 2016. It contains the following updates:

Feature
~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  Site Factory customers can now add additional Site Factory Stacks to
   their subscriptions. A Site Factory Stack is a set of websites and a
   codebase running on dedicated infrastructure. One example of how Site
   Factory Stacks could be used would be to allow customers to manage
   both Drupal 7 and Drupal 8 websites from the same
   |acquia-product:sfi|. For more information, see `Using Site Factory
   Stacks </site-factory/tiers/stacks>`__.

Changes
~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  **Encrypted backups**

   Website backups are now encrypted in storage.

-  **View more data about a website in its thumbnail**

   The thumbnail for each website on the Sites page grid view now
   includes an information icon. When you hover over the information
   icon, you can see the website's creation date, its owner, and the
   Site Factory Stack that it belongs to.

-------------------------------------

*22 March 2016*

|acquia-product:edg| contains the following updates:

Features
~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  **Protect your sites and site collections from unauthorized visitors
   during development**

   You can configure a site collection to use the
   `Shield <https://www.drupal.org/project/shield>`__ module to require
   website visitors to enter a username and password (using HTTP
   authentication) to be able to view your website. This can be useful
   for shielding websites while they are still under development,
   providing an extra measure of protection to ensure that your hosted
   websites are not exposed to unauthorized visitors, while still
   providing access to users who are working on the websites. `Learn
   more </site-factory/users/shield>`__.

-  **Refresh your Factory's website thumbnail images**

   To make it easier to identify at a glance the website you want to
   work with, when you clear your websites' caches, |acquia-product:edg|
   now refreshes the thumbnail images that represent websites in the
   Factory interface. `Learn
   more </site-factory/manage/website/cache>`__.

-  **Automatically assign roles on hosted websites to platform admins**

   You can now configure |acquia-product:edg| to automatically assign
   roles on hosted websites to users with either the *site builder* role

   |acquia-product:edg| module is not one of the two most
   recently-released versions.

   The Factory interface includes a new administration page that users
   with the platform admin role can use to customize two permissions.
   Using the Manage permissions page, platform admins can control which
   roles enable users to set the primary site for a site collection, and
   which roles enable users to manage custom domains for a website or
   site collection. `Learn more </site-factory/manage/sf-perm>`__.

Changes

Features
~~~~~~~~~~~~

   You can now develop custom Drupal distributions for
   |acquia-product:edg| that are based on Drupal 8! If you are using a
   Drupal 8 custom distribution, note the following requirements and
   restrictions:

   -  Drupal 8 distributions cannot be used in the same subscription as
      Drupal 7 distributions. If you are currently using
      |acquia-product:edg|, you will need to create a new subscription
      to use a Drupal 8 custom distribution.
   -  Single sign-on from the Factory management interface to Drupal 8
      websites managed by |acquia-product:edg| is not currently
      available. You must sign on separately to the Factory interface
      and to the Drupal 8 websites it manages. `Learn
      more </site-factory/manage/login-mode>`__.
   -  You must install and enable version 8.x-1.20 or greater of the
      `|acquia-product:edg|
      Connector <https://www.drupal.org/project/acsf>`__ module.

-  **Do your site development work in its own environment**

   The Dev environment is now available to all PaaS customers for your
   development work, in addition to the previously available Stage and
   Prod environments. The Dev environment is now displayed as a staging
   option on the Staging Deployment page, so that you can stage websites
   from Prod to either Dev or Stage.

-  **Know when your site backups are complete**

   When you use the Factory interface to create a backup of a website,
   you are now notified by email when the backup is complete and
   available for download. `Learn
   more </site-factory/manage/website/backup>`__.

-  **Better tracking of your active sites**

   The new Subscription Usage page in the Factory interface displays how
   many sites and site collections in your |acquia-product:edg|
   subscription already have custom domain names assigned to them.
   `Learn more </site-factory/manage/usage>`__.

Fixed issues
~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  During staging, accounts marked as 'do not scrub' would nonetheless
   have their email addresses scrubbed on the staging environment.
   (DG-14913)
-  The All my sites page displayed the link to the Site Backups page in
   its grid view, but not in its list view. (DG-15010)
