|acquia-product:edg| and Drupal
===============================

If you already know Drupal, you may wonder what benefits and features
|acquia-product:edg| adds.

Although |acquia-product:edg| is built using Drupal, it provides
additional tools and services to help you focus on **building** sites,
instead of **how** to build sites.

The following list explains some of the differences between
|acquia-product:edg| and a stock Drupal website:

-  **Hosting and monitoring** - |acquia-product:edg| provides a
   high-availability hosting and monitoring infrastructure across
   multiple web servers, with Varnish caching and replicated database
   servers. An operations team is on call 24/7 to test your site and
   keep it up-to-date with all the relevant updates and security
   patches.
   All of this is based on the same |acelink|_ 
   infrastructure that powers and protects some of the largest and most
   active Drupal sites in the world. With |acquia-product:edg|, you can
   stop worrying about site speed, site traffic, disk space, up-time,
   and backups.
-  **Single sign-on, multisite management** - Instead of signing in to
   multiple websites, if they're on |acquia-product:edg|, sign in once
   to |acquia-product:edg| to sign in to all of them. This helps users
   reduce the number of accounts and passwords they have to keep track
   of, and it allows |acquia-product:edg| website administrators to view
   and manage all of their websites from a single interface.
-  **Acquia Support** - |acquia-product:edg| provides you with access to
   Acquia support, providing you with professional Drupal support and
   how-to guidance, even for custom CSS. Accounts are also entitled to
   support tickets, where they can have one-on-one private support
   conversations.
-  **Open software-as-a-service (SaaS)** - There's no vendor lock-in
   with |acquia-product:edg|. If you decide that you want to move your
   website to another hosting service, or even host it yourself, you can
   `export your website </site-factory/manage/website/backup>`__ at any
   time.
