Viewing activity notifications
==============================

The |acquia-product:ui| notifies you of activities on your applications, so you 
can keep track of events and changes.

To view notifications about an application, complete the following steps:

#. Sign in to the |acquia-product:ui|_, and then select your application.
#. In the upper right of the interface page, click the bell icon 
   ( |Activity icon| ) to view your recent notifications.

   |Open the activity log|

#. Click the arrow in a notification to view more information about the activity.

   |View detail about an activity|

|Activity in progress|\ When an action is in progress, the bell icon changes to a revolving arrow that also indicates the number of active tasks.
