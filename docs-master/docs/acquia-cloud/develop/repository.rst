You can manage your Drupal code in |acquia-product:ac| using Git, a
version control system (VCS),. You can use the command-line versions of
Git or various GUI tools that include open source, commercial IDE
plugins, or GUI clients.

Note

Acquia does not provide support for third-party version control
management tools.

Learn about `Using Git </acquia-cloud/develop/repository/git>`__ with
|acquia-product:ac|.

After you configure your environment to work with the code repository
that you'll use to manage your codebase on |acquia-product:ac|, you can
`check out a local copy of your
codebase </acquia-cloud/develop/checkout>`__ from the remote code
repository.
