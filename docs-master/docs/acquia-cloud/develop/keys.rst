Managing your product keys
==========================

|acquia-product:ac| allows you to store different product and feature
keys in your subscription. If you are an organization's *Owner* or
*Administrator*, you can use the **Product Keys** page to view and
manage these product keys. For more information about roles in
|acquia-product:ac|, see `Working with roles and
permissions </acquia-cloud/teams/roles>`__.

Note

|acquia-product:ac| displays the **Product Keys** link for all roles,
but it is enabled only for the *Owner* or *Administrator* roles.

To view your subscription's keys, complete the following steps:

#. Sign in to the |acquia-product:ac| interface as an *Owner* or
   *Administrator* for your subscription.
#. Click **Develop**.
#. In the application section for which you want to see the keys, click
   **Manage**.
#. In the left menu, click **Product Keys**.

The webpage will display a list of keys for your application. Add-ons,
including |acquia-product:anc|, display their keys here.

|Product key example|

By default, your product key is hidden from display. Click the **Show
key** link to display the key, or click the **Hide key** link to hide it
again.
