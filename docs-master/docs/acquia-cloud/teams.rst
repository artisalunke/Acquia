The Acquia teams and permissions system enables you to control who in
your organization has access to the tools you use to manage your
websites or other applications.

Using the Acquia teams and permissions system, you can do the following:

-  Create teams of developers.
-  Assign roles to team members.
-  Give teams access to your |acquia-product:ac| applications.
-  Modify roles, specifying over 40 different permissions available in
   each role.

The teams and permissions feature controls actions that users can take
using the |acquia-product:ui|. It controls actions such as:

.. list-table::
   :widths: 90 10
   :header-rows: 1Â
