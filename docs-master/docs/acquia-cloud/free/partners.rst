Limitations
~~~~~~~~~~~

Acquia provides |acquia-product:ac| for Partners as a free service to
its partners, with the following limitations:

-  You cannot purchase or use application support tickets. You can use
   platform tickets normally.
-  You cannot cancel your |acquia-product:ac| for Partners subscription.
-  You cannot resize your |acquia-product:ac| for Partners server
   instance. If you need to increase the size of your instance, you must
   convert to a paid |acquia-product:acs| or |acquia-product:ace|
   subscription. You can configure your server instance to select a
   different PHP version. If you need to relaunch, reboot, or suspend
   your server instance, you must contact Acquia Support.
-  The |acquia-product:ui| may display an error if you try to add more
   than 15 applications to your |acquia-product:ac| for Partners server
   instance. If you need to create more applications than this, open a
   ticket with Acquia Support. Depending on the nature of your
   applications, 15 applications may be far more than the instance can
   handle.
-  You cannot transfer ownership of an |acquia-product:ac| for Partners
   website, unless you convert it into a paid |acquia-product:ac|
   subscription. See `How to upgrade |acquia-product:ac| for

How to upgrade|acquia-product:ac| for Partners
----------------------------------------------

If you are using |acquia-product:ac| for Partners to develop an
|acquia-product:ac| website for a client, you typically want to transfer
control of the website to the client once your development job is
complete. You cannot, however, transfer ownership of your free
|acquia-product:ac| for Partners website.

Instead, you need to convert it into a paid |acquia-product:ac|

Partner Development Representative for more details.
