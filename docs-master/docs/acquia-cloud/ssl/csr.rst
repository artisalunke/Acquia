The first step in obtaining an SSL certificate to use with
|acquia-product:ac| is to generate a Certificate Signing Request, or
CSR. The CSR contains information about your organization and website
that a Certificate Authority can use to generate the appropriate SSL
certificate for your website.

If you already have an SSL certificate, or if you choose to generate a
CSR some other way (such as `using the command
line </acquia-cloud/ssl/csr/cli>`__), you can skip this page. However,
only CSRs generated using the |acquia-product:ui| are managed and
displayed in the |acquia-product:ui| on the **SSL** page.

To generate a CSR:

#. Sign in to the |cloud-ui| as
   a user with the necessary
   `permissions </acquia-cloud/ssl#permissions>`__.
#. Select your organization, application, and environment and then, in
   the left menu, click **SSL**.
#. On the SSL page, click **Generate CSR**.

   |Enter information to generate a CSR|

#. On the **Generate new certificate signing request** page, enter the
   following information:

   -  **Country** - Use the standard two-letter ISO country code for the
      country where your organization is located. For example, *US* or
      *ZA*
   -  **State, province, or region** - Use the full state or province
      name, without abbreviation. For example, *California*, not *CA*,
      and *New Brunswick*, not *NB*
   -  **Locality** - Use the city or town name, without abbreviation
   -  **Organization or company** - Use the full legal name of the
      organization or company that owns the domain name
   -  **Department or organizational unit** - Optional. Use the name of
      the department or organizational unit for the domain
   -  **Common name** (domain name) - Enter the fully qualified domain
      name that visitors use to reach your website, without the
      ``http://`` or ``https://`` protocol element. For example, to
      secure ``https://www.example.com``, enter ``www.example.com`` or
      ``*.example.com`` for a wildcard certificate
   -  **Subject alternative name(s)** - Optional. Enter additional
      domain names, separated by commas â€” for example,
      ``www.example.net, www.example.org``. Adding additional domain
      names will generate a CSR appropriate for a UCC (Unified
      Communications Certificate) SSL certificate

#. Click **Generate CSR**.

|acquia-product:ac| generates a CSR, based on the information you
provided.

Using a CSR to obtain an SSL certificate
----------------------------------------

All the CSRs that have been generated for an environment are listed on
the **SSL** page. You need to provide the CSR in encoded format to your
SSL certificate vendor in order to obtain an SSL certificate. To get the
CSR in encoded format:

#. On the **SSL** page, under **Certificate signing requests**, click
   **View** to view the CSR.
#. On the **SSL certificate signing request** page, on the PEM line,
   click **Show**.

   |Displaying the encoded CSR|

#. |acquia-product:ac| displays the encoded CSR. Copy the encoded CSR
   and provide it to your SSL certificate vendor in the vendor's
   certificate purchase process.

After you generate and copy the CSR, use it to `obtain an SSL
certificate </acquia-cloud/ssl/purchase>`__.
