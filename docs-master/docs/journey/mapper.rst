|acquia-product:aj| Mapper
==========================

|acquia-product:aj| has a customer *Journey Mapper* that enables you to
create visual representations of the customer experience, mapping it to
the underlying `graphs </journey/getting-started/graph>`__ that execute
and support the customer journey. Each customer journey can be
associated with many graphs, `metrics, and
goals </journey/getting-started/metrics>`__, and can also be `saved as
templates </journey/getting-started/graph/template>`__ to be reused in
separate projects.

In the **Journey Mapper** view, if a node is associated with a certain
metric, it can be expanded and brought up to show a graph that depicts
how the metric has changed over time, making a visual graph that can be
shared with others.
