Comment node
============

|Comment node|

The Comment node allows you to add annotations to your graph, so you can
provide additional information to aid in understanding your graph
configuration. You do not need to connect a comment node to any other
nodes in your graph for your graph to validate, as comment nodes are
self-contained.

Adding a comment node

graph </journey/getting-started/graph>`__, perform the following

#. Click the **Project Editor** |Project Editor icon| icon.
#. Double-click the `existing
   graph </journey/getting-started/graph>`__\  you want to modify.
#. Right-click in the white (background) area of the graph, and select
   **Add Node To Graph**.
#. Scroll through the list of node types to find the **Basic Nodes**
   section, and click **Comment**:
#. Click **Add Comment**.

Your comment will appear on the graph. It can be edited by clicking the
**Pencil** icon in the top right-hand corner, providing the text of your
comment, and clicking **Save**. Comments can be resized with the **Grab
