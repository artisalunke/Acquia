Using a graph template
======================

A template is a graph with predefined nodes and links that can serve as
a starting point when `creating a new
graph </journey/getting-started/graph>`__. For more information about
nodes, see `Nodes in |acquia-product:aj| </journey/node>`__.

Creating a graph from a template
--------------------------------

To create a new graph from an existing template, complete the following
actions:

#. On the **Home Screen**, identify the project that you want to
   customize.
#. In the project's tile, click the Project Editor icon |Project Editor
   icon|.
#. Click the Action menu icon |Action menu icon| in the top left of the
   screen.
#. Click **Create New**.
#. In the **Custom Graph Templates** section, click a graph template to
   select it.
#. In the **Name** field, enter a name for your graph.
#. Click **Create New Item** at the bottom of the page to create your
   graph. If your project includes any graphs, nodes, or adaptors with
   identical names to those provided by the graph template, creating the
   new graph will fail. You must ensure any existing graphs, nodes, and
   adaptors do not conflict with those in the graph template you
   selected.
#. Make any changes you need to the graph as you would normally.

Sharing a graph template
------------------------

To share a graph as a template within your organization, complete the
following actions:

#. On the **Home Screen**, identify the project you want to customize.
#. In the project's tile, click the Project Editor icon |Project Editor
   icon|.
#. Click the Action menu icon |Action menu icon| in the top left of the
   screen, and then click **Share Graph**.
#. Enter a **Name** for your graph template.
#. Click on one or more graphs in the **Graphs** section to include in
   your graph template. You must select at least one graph.
   A graph is selected if its row background has changed.
#. Click **Convert to Template** to create your graph template. Your
   graph template will appear in the `previously described <#create>`__
   **Custom Graph Templates** section.

Any adaptors and nodes associated with your selected templates will be
included in the graph template package.
