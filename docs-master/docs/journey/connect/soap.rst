SOAP web service connection
===========================

|acquia-product:aj| supports Simple Object Access Protocol (SOAP) web
services as well as `REST web services </journey/connect/rest>`__. To
create a new SOAP web service connection, `add a new
connection </journey/connect>`__, being sure to click SOAP Web Service
in the **Type** list.

Unlike the REST web services the Web Service Definition (WSDL) location
is given at the connection level rather than on the individual
environment levels. Highlight the connection in the list of connections
and then populate the **WSDL Location URL**.
