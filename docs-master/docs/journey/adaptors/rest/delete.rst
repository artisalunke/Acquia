Web service: DELETE method
==========================

For instructions about how to modify the URL resource and query
parameters, see `REST web service adaptor </journey/adaptors/rest>`__.

The Web Service DELETE method calls the DELETE method on the specified
connection. To create a web service DELETE method, it is first necessary
to create a `web service connection </journey/connect/rest>`__.

After you create or select the REST Web Service adaptor, review the
values in the following lists:

-  **Adaptor Connection**
-  **Method** - Be sure this is set to **DELETE**
