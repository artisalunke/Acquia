Web service: PUT method
=======================

For instructions about how to modify the URL resource and query
parameters, see `REST web service adaptor </journey/adaptors/rest>`__.

The Web Service PUT method calls the PUT method on the specified
connection. To create a web service PUT method, it is first necessary to
create a `web service connection </journey/connect/rest>`__.

After you create or select the REST Web Service adaptor, review the
values in the following lists:

-  **Adaptor Connection**
-  **Method** - Be sure this is set to **PUT**
