A database allows you to store and query data related to your business
processes. When combined with |acquia-product:aj|, you can create
data-driven journeys for visitors based on information stored in
databases used by external services.

Your `graphs </journey/getting-started/graph>`__ in your customer
journey can interact with external databases through the following
adaptors:

-  `Read </journey/adaptors/database/read>`__ - Retrieve information
   from a database using SQL statements
-  `Write </journey/adaptors/database/write>`__ - Insert information
   into a database using SQL statements
-  `Listen </journey/adaptors/database/listen>`__ - Enable a graph to
   react to the results of a SQL query on an ongoing basis
-  `Delete </journey/adaptors/database/delete>`__ - Remove information
   from a database using an SQL statement
