Reporting issues, feature requests, and bugs
============================================

You can report to Acquia any issues you encounter while using
|acquia-product:add|. To do this, in the application menu, go to **Help
> Report an issue**. If possible, `enable verbose
logging </dev-desktop/troubleshooting#verbose>`__ and reproduce the
issue before you send your report. Provide as much information as you
can about what you were doing and what you saw when you encountered the
problem. In addition to the information you provide in the form, this
issue reporting feature sends logs and configuration information to
Acquia to help us diagnose the issue. If you are not running the latest
version of |acquia-product:add|, you will be prompted to update before
you send an issue report.
