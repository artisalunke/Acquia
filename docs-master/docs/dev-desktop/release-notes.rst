Features
~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  **Generate SSH key pairs**

   In order to sync a local website with Acquia Cloud, you need to

   have one, you can now generate a public/private key pair using Acquia
   Dev Desktop. `Learn more </dev-desktop2/keygen>`__.

   Cloud subscription through a proxy. `Learn

-  **PHP 7 support**

   Acquia Dev Desktop now includes PHP 7. This version of PHP provides
   substantial performance benefits, especially for Drupal 8. Note,
   however, that PHP 7 does not include many PHP extensions that are
   included with the PHP 5 versions, because they are not available yet.

   database** phase, since Acquia Dev Desktop provides the database
   credentials. (IN-2117)

   that ``drush make`` now works. (IN-2123)

   80 and the default HTTPS/SSL port of 443. `Learn
   more </dev-desktop2/config#ports>`__.
-  When you clone an Acquia Cloud website, you can choose not to clone
