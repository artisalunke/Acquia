Managing a single website is very different from managing several (or
many) websites. Decisions that are uncomplicated with a single website
can become hopelessly complicated when the overlapping and conflicting
needs of many website properties are managed as a group. As a result,
many organizations have chosen to standardize their digital properties
on a common platform, but struggle with the process of designing and
building the platform that meets their needs, migrating disparate
properties to that platform, and maintaining the platform after it is
built.

*Platform governance* can help speed the development of your platform,
streamline its management, and ensure its success after launch. Acquia
defines governance as a decision-making framework that enables an
organization to assign ownership, set priorities, and define shared
guidelines, standards, and processes for all platform users.

   |acquia-product:edg|, see 
   `Governance on Acquia Cloud Site Factory </site-factory/governance>`__.

Properly implemented, platform governance can provide the following
benefits to your organization:

-  *Improve strategy and ownership* – Establishing roles and
   responsibilities leads to clear lines of communication for
   enterprise-wide goals
-  *Define policies and standards* – Reduce risk and improve consistency
   by establishing enterprise-wide standards for corporate branding,
   data collection, storage, and content standards
-  *Streamline business and technical processes* – Deliver digital
   experiences more consistently and efficiently by establishing agile
   development processes to support both enterprise-wide priorities and
   brand-specific priorities
-  *Develop a platform that meets your needs* – Establish a content
   management platform capable of scaling to support enterprise-wide
   goals, including a common feature set and reusable components

In this series, we discuss the types of governance your properties may
need, how that governance can be implemented, and how to use governance
to architect, build, migrate to, and maintain the platform that meets
your organization's unique needs.

Common governance challenges
----------------------------

Organizations with insufficient or ineffective platform governance over
their online properties can see multiple types of problems develop in
their online presence, ranging from organizational challenges, delivery
challenges, and user experience challenges.

Organizational challenges
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Enterprise-wide initiatives and goals are often unclear in organizations
without sufficient governance. Situations like this can make it
difficult for employees and teams to work together, causing an unequal
allocation of available resources. There may not be a clear definition
of roles or responsibilities across the enterprise, nor visibility into
what digital solutions exist to improve how teams work together.

Delivery challenges
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In organizations without sufficient governance, a lack of mature
delivery processes can lead to development teams not consistently or
efficiently delivering projects. Solutions chosen may not be flexible
enough to meet the needs of different brands or markets. Teams may
appear busy, because every issue gets top priority, but it is unclear
what work is being done, or what goals this work is intended to meet.

User experience challenges
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Organizations lacking governance eventually see these internal problems
begin to affect their end users. A lack of governance can lead to
inconsistent branding experiences, including different messaging across
different touch points in the customer journey, making it more difficult
for users to connect to your brand.

Common governance mistakes
--------------------------

Avoiding some of the most common mistakes and misperceptions of
platform-building will increase the likelihood of your project’s
success. Some of the possible mistakes include the following:

-  *Insufficient planning or no​ ​planning*
   Agile development frameworks do not take the place of adequate
   planning to ensure a project is ​effective at achieving the
   prescribed business goals.
-  *Not building a demo*
   ​Building a live website and then launching it, instead of first
   building a demo website or profile, may cause features and
   functionality possibly needed by other websites on the platform to
   not be included.
-  *Building a website instead of a platform*
   ​Building websites before gaining​ ​alignment​ on shared features
   ​among​ ​platform​ ​users increases complexity later in the project,
   and increases the likelihood of project failure.
-  *Not following minimum viable product (MVP) approaches*
   ​Starting from the minimum viable product for your demo website or
   profile enables you to build broad agreement regarding platform
   features. This allows teams to refine and adjust features and
   functionality before the demo is broadly deployed, which can result
   in lower development costs.
-  *Not seeking sign-offs for demos*
   ​Proceeding with website development before getting agreement from
   all stakeholders regarding the platform’s baseline can mean that
   critical pieces of functionality are missed. This can affect project
   complexity in the short term, and adoption and use of the finished
   platform in the long term.
-  *Not establishing rules for inclusion*
   ​Recognizing that certain websites (such as standalone microsites)
   may not belong on your platform can save you significant development
   costs, instead of attempting to develop a platform that meets 100% of
   every website’s needs, regardless of the websites' requirements.

Understanding your organization’s needs
---------------------------------------

Establishing an effective governance model requires you to understand
and document key aspects of your business and operations, including the
following:

-  *Your technical personnel* – What groups will be involved in planning
   your platform? Who are your platform’s users and maintainers? Will
   your development or maintenance require access to third parties, such
   as contractors or agencies?
-  *Your business personnel* – How will your technical personnel
   interact with other business groups, such as marketers? What aspects
   of your platform will be owned by technical personnel, and what
   aspects will be owned by others? What level of support should you
   expect from these groups?
-  *Your goals* – Goals that are easy to measure with a single website
   can be more challenging to measure on a platform. Understanding your
   definition of success, and how it is measured, will help you
   architect a platform that enables success.

Documenting your governance policy
----------------------------------

Your governance policy should provide clear guidance on all aspects of
building, maintaining, and expanding your platform. Although no two
governance policies are exactly the same, some common topics in
governance policies include, but are not limited to the following:

-  Governance structure
-  Committee responsibilities
-  Legal and security compliance guidelines
-  Accessibility
-  Request and appeal processes
-  Roles and permissions
-  Editorial workflow
-  Training and education
-  Branding and messaging guidelines
-  Guidelines for visual content (such as videos)
-  Social media use
-  Mobile applications
-  Measurement and analytics
-  Change management
