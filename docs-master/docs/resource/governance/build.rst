When establishing governance requirements and policies, you will need to
examine your organization’s existing policies, workflows, and internal
structures for potential challenges and opportunities. Although your
governance policy will be unique to your organization’s structure and
needs, be sure to review the following common topics:

-  `Approvals and reviews <#approvals-and-reviews>`__
-  `Feature requests and management <#feature-requests-and-management>`__
-  `Website groups and profiles <#website-groups-and-profiles>`__

Approvals and reviews
---------------------

Examine your organization for lines of approval regarding content or
features. Must new content be approved by a brand marketing team, a
legal team, or a security team? Do new technical tools require approval
from your organization’s IT team before employees may use them?

You should also investigate if approvals vary depending on location.
Does your organization have a central office, satellite offices, or
franchises? Do different local, state, federal, or international laws
affect your content, how it is approved, or its rollout?

As part of your investigation, for future improvements you should
document the issues that are identified with processes.

Feature requests and management
-------------------------------

Identifying how new feature requests are currently managed and
prioritized is also useful during self-examination. When your
organization undertakes a campaign that requires new features to be
developed, how are these features requested, approved, and funded? Are
there additional stakeholders who should be included, but currently are
not? How much time is needed for a feature request to be approved,
scoped, built, and launched?

To establish initial guidelines, create a feature matrix similar to the
following example. Identify your brands, your proposed features, and
their intersections to establish a baseline feature set for your
platform, and to confirm whether an individual website or property is a
good fit for your proposed platform.

Website groups and profiles
---------------------------

Organizations with many properties to manage should identify functional
groupings of properties that share features, theme, purpose, or other
characteristics. Organizations with many websites may choose to develop
an installation profile for each group to balance flexibility and cost.

When identifying groups of properties, look for common points of
similarity, such as similar editorial workflows, media needs, or
approval processes.

On the next page in this series, you'll learn more about using the
information you've gathered and the architecture you've designed to
`plan your migration strategy </resource/governance/migrate>`__.
