There is no single, perfect model for governance. When creating
governance policies for your organization, you should consider your
organization's needs, resources, and goals to determine what model of
governance is most appropriate for your organization's needs:whether a
centralized, decentralized, or hybrid model of governance is appropriate
for your needs.

Decentralized model of governance
---------------------------------

In a decentralized governance model, independence is valued over shared
resources. Each brand works independently, with separate teams, budgets,
technologies, strategies, and capabilities — with little sharing of
resources or tools.

The following diagram demonstrates a decentralized governance model,
where each brand has access to its own digital team, agency, and support
structure:

A decentralized approach excels in creating highly-flexible sites with
significant brand- and market-specific customizations, and provide a
faster time-to-market in the short term, but runs the risk of siloed
development and inconsistent standards hindering shared development of
resources in the long term. Brands with few resources may struggle to
innovate in a decentralized model if they cannot access the development
resources of brands with more resources.

Centralized model of governance
-------------------------------

In a centralized governance model, common tooling and experiences are
valued over brand independence. While a centralized governance model can
keep costs low, it can come at the expense of a cookie-cutter experience
across brands, with little opportunity for customization or
localization, because the central organization decides on a unified set
of tools. A centralized model can also provide strong and focused
governance in industries where high regulatory oversight is needed.

For a visual demonstrates a centralized governance model, where every
brand receives access to the same corporate and digital resources,
review the following diagram:

A centralized approach excels at reducing costs and time-to-market while
emphasizing consistency of brand and message, but a lack of flexibility
for brand or niche markets may create generic market experiences that
are poorly perceived.

Hybrid model of governance
--------------------------

The hybrid model of governance allows for sharing resources and tools
while providing flexibility when needed. Common processes are
established to gather information about the brands’ needs, and building
features that support the majority of the brands’ common needs. The goal
is to build a model that efficiently leverages resources and tools to
drive innovation at a lower cost.

The following diagram demonstrates a hybrid governance model, where
brands are provided access to centralized corporate direction, with the
flexibility to implement the direction as is appropriate for their
brand:

A hybrid approach to governance ensures organization-wide goals and
priorities are defined, but flexible, giving brands the opportunity to
innovate. It requires greater coordination across brands than a
centralized model of governance, resulting in a longer time-to-market,
and will result in features that are designed to support the most common
requirements of brands and markets while sacrificing some of the
flexibility in a more decentralized model of governance.
