Acquia Status page
==================

The `Acquia Status page <http://status.acquia.com>`__ provides the latest information about emergency maintenance, platform-wide service interruptions, and security issues affecting any of the major Acquia platforms and products, with separate status alerts for each platform and product.

Viewing incidents
-----------------

The Status page also gives updates on individual incidents as they occur. When an incident is first posted, it is marked as *Investigating*. We then update the status to *Identified*, *Monitoring*, or *Resolved*, with the appropriate information. Not every incident will pass through each of these statuses. For example, we may have a temporary blip that is resolved quickly and the status might go directly from *Investigating* to *Resolved*, skipping *Identified* and *Monitoring*.

Change to emergency communication practices
-------------------------------------------

Acquia will not send emergency alert email messages directly to customer contacts for any issue that can be adequately covered by updates to status.acquia.com.

Acquia will send email or generate mass tickets if a situation cannot be adequately covered by `status.acquia.com <http://status.acquia.com>`__ or if the message is specific to a set of customers that cannot be represented on status.acquia.com.

Ensuring that you receive Acquia maintenance notices
----------------------------------------------------

Acquia Support uses Marketo to send notices to Acquia-hosting customers regarding important maintenance issues. In most cases, customers should not have issues receiving these emails. If you have configured your email server to not accept certain content, you may have to add certain IP address ranges to your server's `whitelist <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whitelist>`__ to ensure that you receive these emails. `Contact Acquia Support </support#contact>`__ for assistance with configuring your email server's whitelist for accepted emails.
