|Remote Administration|

Acquia’s Remote Site Administration service (RA) allows Acquia to handle typical and routine Drupal administration tasks so your team can focus on developing new features or on completing other high-value tasks. Administration includes normal maintenance tasks and minor website modifications that an on-site administrator would typically handle through the Drupal administrative user interface for a fully designed and operating website. You can create `work requests </ra/request>`__ for an Acquia administrator by `creating a support ticket online </support/tickets>`__ or `calling Acquia support </support/guide#contact_support>`__.
