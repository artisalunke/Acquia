|acquia-product:cha| both provides and supports the ability to connect
to several different automated marketing software products.

Using a provided connector enables you to import stored user information
and combine it with |acquia-product:cha| profiles, which can then be
connected with your visitors' activities. Activities are visitors'
actions on and off of your website, such as receiving an email or
downloading a whitepaper. This additional data provides deeper insights
into visitors' identities, preferences, and behavior both on your
website and through other channels such as email.

You can use this data to create `segments </lift/profile-mgr/segment>`__
and target visitors with personalized content. For example, you can
create a segment that includes visitors who have clicked a link for a
particular email marketing campaign, and then target those visitors with
personalized web experiences.
