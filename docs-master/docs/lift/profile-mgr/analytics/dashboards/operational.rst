The **Operational** dashboard contains several reports that when viewed
together provide you an overview of visitors' activities on your
website.

This dashboard contains the following reports:

-  **People** - Number of visitors to your website per day, displayed in
   a timeline
-  **Touches** - Number of touches your website visitors performed per
   day, displayed in a timeline
-  **Events** - Number of unique events per day, displayed in a timeline
-  **Events by event name** - Number of events per day, organized by
   event name and displayed as a table
-  **People by identifier type** - Number of visitors to your website
   per day, organized by the identifiers the visitor has provided to
   |acquia-product:cha| (for example, email address) or that
   |acquia-product:cha| has assigned to the visitor (for example,
   tracking ID), and displayed as a bar graph
-  **Touches by channel type** - Number of touches per day, organized by
   the channels from which the data was provided (for example, ``Web``
   for data coming from your website or ``API`` for data passed through
   an API) and displayed as a bar graph

Note

The reports on the **Operational** dashboards cannot be filtered to
display different data. You can access versions of those reports that
allow data filtering by clicking the names of the reports in the left
sidebar.
