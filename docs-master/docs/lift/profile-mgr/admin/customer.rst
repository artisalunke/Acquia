Updating your customer details
==============================

As an |acquia-product:cha| subscriber, your customer settings contain
information about your subscription, including information about your
time zone, API authentication requirements, and any custom identifier
types that you want to use.

To view the customer information available for you to access, complete
the following steps:

#. `Sign in </lift/profile-mgr#signing>`__ to the |acquia-product:lpm|
   interface, and then click the **Admin** tab.
#. Click the **Manage customers** link.

The Manage Customers webpage displays the list of customers and their
configurations that are available to you as a table. In most cases, you
will only see one result — your own customer subscription.

Editing customer settings
-------------------------

To edit a customer entry's settings, complete the following steps:

#. On the Manage Customers webpage, find the customer that you want to
   configure, and then click its **Account ID** value.

   The Customer Details page displays for the selected customer.

#. Review and modify the following settings based on your requirements:

   -  **Name** - A descriptive name for the customer, which is displayed
      on the Manage Customers webpage in the **Name** column
   -  **Description** - A description of the customer, which is
      displayed on the Manage Customers webpage in the **Description**
      column
   -  **Time Zone** - The time zone for the customer
   -  **Mask Last Portion of IP Addresses** check box - Select this
      check box to change the final IP address value for visitors to
      zero (0) when storing the value. This setting applies to both IPv4
      (xxx.xxx.xxx.0) and IPv6 addresses
      (xxxx:xxxx:xxxx:xxxx:xxxx:xxxx:xxxx:0), and modifies addresses
      that are collected and stored only during the timeframe that this
      check box is selected.
   -  **API Authentication** section - Select the check boxes for the
      API calls you want to enable for use from the |acquia-product:cha| 
      `REST API </lift/omni/rest_api>`__:

      -  **Enable Segment REST Api HMAC Authentication**
      -  **Enable Event Import REST Api HMAC Authentication**
      -  **Enable File Export REST Api HMAC Authentication**
      -  **Enable Visitor Query REST Api HMAC Authentication**

   -  **Person Identifier Types** section -

      -  **Hashed** column - Select this check box for each identifier
         type whose values you want to encrypt when saving collected
         visitor identifier information. Identifier information that is
         hashed is blocked from all users, even during data exports.

         .. note:: The **Customer Type** setting cannot be modified. Its value is defaulted to **Drupal** to support |acquia-product:cha| customers who primarily use Drupal for data collection and personalization.

#. Click **Save** to save your changes.

Default identifier types

     - ``tracking``
   * - Twitter ID
     - Visitor's Twitter ID
     - ``twitter``


Adding custom identifier types
------------------------------

You can add additional, custom identifier types to your customer
subscription information to identify your visitors. For example, if your
website has a high percentage of business-related traffic, you could add
a custom identifier type for visitors' LinkedIn account information.

.. important:: You cannot edit or delete any identifier types after they are associated with a customer subscription, including both standard and custom identifier types.

To add a new custom identifier type to your customer subscription,
complete the following steps:

#. Go to the Customer Details webpage for a specific customer.
#. In the **Person Identifier Types** section, click the **Add new
   person identifier type** link.
#. Enter values for the custom identifier type in the following fields:

   -  **Identifier Type** - Descriptive name of the custom identifier
      type, used for display in |acquia-product:lpm|
   -  **API identifier name** - The name of the custom identifier type
      as used by the |acquia-product:cha| service, which accepts only
      characters, and no spaces, numbers, or special characters
   -  **Description** - Longer, descriptive information about the custom
      identifier type
   -  **Is this identifier resolvable?** check box - Select this check
      box if the identifier type refers to unique visitors, and clear
      the check box if the identifier type is not unique between
      visitors. For example, the standard identifier type of email is
      unique to a specific person, and therefore resolvable, while the
      name is not (as many visitors can share a name with another
      person).

#. Click **OK** to return to the Customer Details webpage.
#. Click **Save** to save your new custom identifier type, along with
   any other changes you made to the settings on the Customer Details
   webpage.

Reviewing your AWS-related information
--------------------------------------

(depending on your subscription) you can use as you access your visitor
data stored on the |acquia-product:cha| service.

Each set of customer details includes the following values (which you
cannot modify):

-  **AWS Access Key ID** - Part of your Amazon Web Services access key,
   used for accessing your allocated AWS resources (such as your Amazon
   S3 directory)
-  **AWS Secret Access Key** - Part of your Amazon Web Services access
   key, used for accessing your allocated AWS resources (such as your
   Amazon S3 directory)
-  **S3 Bucket URL** - The location of your Amazon S3 directory, used by
   the |acquia-product:cha| service for bulk file imports and exports
