Understanding rule cards
========================

After creating a `rule </lift/exp-builder/rule>`__ in
|acquia-product:cha|, you can view all of the information regarding that
rule on its *rule card*.

The rule card is what is displayed when you are using the |acquia-product:cha|
`sidebar </lift/exp-builder/access>`__, and it
provides you a summary of the rule configuration.

At the left-most portion of the example card is a vertical grey bar,
which indicates that this is a draft, unpublished rule. Because of this,
it will not be live on the website and is not available for decisions.

To the right of the grey bar, if the content being shared includes an
image, the rule card will display a thumbnail preview of the image.

Finally, the rule details are listed, described as follows:

-  The first line indicates the type of rule and the rule name. If the
   name is longer than the card, point to the title to see the full
   name:

   -  |Target icon| **Target** - A basic rule with a goal — often a
      basic click-through goal.
   -  |A/B test icon| **Pie chart** - Indicates that the rule is an A/B
      test.

-  |Segment icon| **Segment** - The segment in use for the rule.
   Defaults to **Everyone**.
-  |Slot name icon| **Slot name** - The name of the slot that the rule
   is in.
